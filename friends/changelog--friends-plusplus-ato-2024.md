**Adam Stacoviak:** So what I'm bringing up is this idea that this -- like, you had the Ford Bronco come back, and that was gas-based, not EV-based. But then you have this Scout Motors, which I had no idea about a Scout. So this is all new to me.

**Jerod Santo:** No. It's not a Jeep?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't even know, it's not a Jeep.

**Jerod Santo:** It looks like a Jeep.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's not a Jeep, though.

**Jerod Santo:** Is it because Jeep's just a brand?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** A manufacturer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's got this nostalgia from back in the day...

**Jerod Santo:** It's a square SUV... It looks like a Jeep Wrangler.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It looks Bronco-ish too, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Wrangler-ish, Bronco-ish... It's got this--

**Jerod Santo:** It's a Scout.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...this older style to it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm not trying to harp on Scout necessarily, or Scout Motors, but this idea of... This take what was old and modernize it as an EV...

**Jerod Santo:** What if we take what's old and make it new again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. This idea.

**Jerod Santo:** And this is a metaphor for Rails? \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sure... Sure... No, but I was just thinking, "Are you down with that?" Are you down with the idea of take the old school and make it new school, and it's EV new school?

**Jerod Santo:** If it's well-executed.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Because... Take the same exact concept to movies and I say "No", unless it's well-executed. Then I'll say yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Then you'll say yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, for sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's a good, well-executed, since we're going to movies...

**Jerod Santo:** Didn't we do this with -- we tried to figure out when we had Emily Freeman and Justin on the show...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right.

**Jerod Santo:** ...a good remake, or a good reboot. And we decided that Blade Runner was pretty good, and that Dune --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dune was good, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** ...was pretty good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dune's kind of standalone, though. It's a remake, but it's not --

**Jerod Santo:** It's a different version of the same story. They're telling the same story though. It's a reboot.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it is a reboot.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So I'm not against the idea, I'm against the way it's executed poorly. And so if Scout kills it, then I want one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You want one.

**Jerod Santo:** I do want one. Here's why I want an EV... I hate oil changes. \[laughs\] I hate the complication and the complexity of an internal combustion engine. I like the simplicity and the lack of maintenance on an EV. Now, what I don't like about an EV is there's one giant battery that just goes bad eventually, you know? Or blows up. But what I do like about it is I'm used to taking care of batteries... I feel like I can take care of a battery, better than I can take care of... Ice.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I drive an F-250, as you know...

**Jerod Santo:** That's a large internal combustion engine.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a diesel engine. It's even different than a gas engine.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's diesel.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And it has the requirement of DEF fluid. Are you familiar with DEF fluid?

**Jerod Santo:** Say again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** DEF fluid?

**Jerod Santo:** I think I have some DEF fluid in my ear.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hello? DEF? Are you making fun of \[03:32\] on this podcast?

**Jerod Santo:** No, I'm making fun of you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, okay. Gotcha. DEF. I think it stands for...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, DEF Jam Records.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...Diesel Exhaust Fluid, I believe... DEF. Acronym.

**Jerod Santo:** I will believe you, because I have no way of checking it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Me neither. I'm believing me as well. I'm not sure.

**Jerod Santo:** Anybody with a computer could prove that wrong...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, so it requires diesel... Some say diesel. Not diesel.

**Jerod Santo:** I say diesel.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Diesel. I say diesel, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Why did you call it diesel, then?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm cool with either, actually. I'm cool with diesel, or diesel.

**Jerod Santo:** Or Vin Diesel.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. Vin Diesel...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm cool with either one of those.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think he's actually a diesel.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he's more of a diesel, I think.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's the example where it's got to be a Z.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I agree.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So my vehicle requires diesel, as well as DEF fluid...
