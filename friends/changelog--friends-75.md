**Jerod Santo:** Well, Mat is back... But with no guitar.

**Mat Ryer:** No. No, I thought I'd switch things up a little bit... And what I've done is I've brought my piano. Look.

**Jerod Santo:** Love it. I didn't know -- actually, I did know that you played piano, because I think you've sent me a few piano tunes throughout the days... But I kind of forgot.

**Mat Ryer:** I know. I'm better on the piano than -- I can't really play the guitar, to be honest.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you fooled us...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I just learned some tricks... But you don't need to learn how to play. It's like coding. You don't have to learn how to code. You just have to learn a few tricks. Like for the interview.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's true.

**Mat Ryer:** You just have to trick the interviewer that you know how to code.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've been an imposter for a very long, very long time...

**Jerod Santo:** Right. You can't code, but you can LeetCode. That's all you need.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, genuinely though, we are seeing an uptick of people using ChatGPT in interviews.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, really?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. What do you do? What's your stance on that? Would you allow that, or no?

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good question, because to a certain extent it's like "Well, I want to know how much you know about this craft... But also, I want to know what you can do. And let's be honest, if you're going to be doing, you're going to be using some assistance."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And so why not just use the assistance while you're doing the interview? I guess I would leave it up to the interviewer. What would you do, Mat?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I'm with you. I think they are part of the tool chain that we have... So use it. I mean, are we really interviewing people to find out what they know in their brain now, or what they can do, like what they're able to produce?

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I think it depends on what you want.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He just repeated exactly what you said, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** He did. He made me feel smart by just saying it back to me. Is that a trick of yours?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I say it in a British accent, that's what makes it sound smart.

**Jerod Santo:** It makes it sound better. It's like he one-ups me by just saying it back with his accent. Not fair, Mat...

**Adam Stacoviak:** How about this idea, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** We just add a flag to people's column. Like, I'm interviewing Mat. Mat is AI assisted. Cool. That's it.

**Mat Ryer:** Right. Just be honest about it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I'm actually quite cool with being AI-assisted. I'm not cool with just AI. Like, if you're interviewing an AI... Come on. Come on, Meta.

**Jerod Santo:** You don't want to be replaced. You want to be assisted.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I mean, I'm a humanist, man. Okay?

**Jerod Santo:** See, I feel like you're joining my team over here, because I've been saying this for a while...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, AI-assisted is the way to be.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm happy to have you. I think AI-powered --

**Adam Stacoviak:** "I'm happy to have you..." \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** I think human plus AI equals better, but AI plus AI equals disaster.

**Adam Stacoviak:** For now... I've gotta say for now. I've gotta say for now.

**Mat Ryer:** Some people are avoiding using AI ethically, because they're not happy with the copyright that was all stolen.

**Jerod Santo:** Right, right, right.

**Mat Ryer:** So they're sort of opting out of it from an ethical point of view. And they really are kind of giving themselves a disadvantage... All credit to them for it, really, for that... But yeah, if your mission is to just get stuff done... Yeah, AI-assisted. I'm in. It's not very popular to say that, you know?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, let me -- if AI or the LLM, this chat is the evolution of what we had, which compares well to Google... Have you had an issue with people googling things? No, you have not. It's actually expected.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Now. But in the beginning, people said "You're not allowed to use Google. You've got to do this." And then some places -- I think some places still do that. It's like the whiteboard interview.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is interview process only though, right? You're thinking interview process only?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay. So if we go past the interview, I'm totally cool with -- I want to know what your potential is, and what resources you can leverage. So I think of like two things: resourcefulness and resilience. Right? Those are the double Rs right there.

That's the quintessential pair, let's just say.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] It's double Rs... It's the quintessential pair...!

**Jerod Santo:** Why did you stop? That was getting so good.

**Mat Ryer:** It's just a jingle in case you need it. In case that comes up again.

**Jerod Santo:** In case there's another quintessential pair that also starts with R.

**Mat Ryer:** Two Rs. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That was a pretty good abstraction, actually. You didn't say the words, so...

**Mat Ryer:** There you go. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** ...we can reuse it. Adam, think of another couple of Rs later...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay. I'll keep going.

**Jerod Santo:** So I think it was Socrates. I could be wrong on the details of the individual... But there is a very prominent philosopher/academic - I think it's Socrates - who was against writing things down, publicly. He came out and said "We shouldn't write." This was like at the advent of writing, perhaps.

**Mat Ryer:** Right.

**Jerod Santo:** The two Rs... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:07:43.09\] Writing and \[unintelligible 00:07:44.05\] And he just thought that we would lose our brains. Like, we would stop being able to remember things. And I recall when programmable phones were picking up, and you no longer had to memorize people's phone numbers. And there were some folks who were kind of offended by that... Because there was a social dynamic to like whose numbers do you have memorized? It kind of shows who's important to you in your life. And there's certain people like, "I'm just going to remember your phone number." And 10 years later, they're all off that. They're all done. It's over with.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it's gone. Purged.

**Jerod Santo:** Why would you want to remember phone numbers if you don't have to? So...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like some of it's the more typical just "Don't move my cheese" kind of stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I get it. I get why people -- it was like with calculators in my... I remember my cousin wasn't allowed to use a calculator in one of his exams... But I was younger, and we were allowed to use calculators, and he was outraged. I mean, it was an English exam, so it didn't help, but still...

\[singing\] Sometimes your jokes don't go down so well... Don't worry. Don't worry. It's alright...

Just a little one for me there...

**Jerod Santo:** I like how you console yourself. I was just over here thinking how I just missed a huge opportunity when I said the two Rs, writing and \[unintelligible 00:09:05.11\] Because there actually were three Rs. If you recall, in early education, it was reading, writing, and arithmetic. And that's not even a joke. That's what they called it. I mean, it is a joke, but it's hilarious. And I missed that opportunity... So I'm just recovering that and getting it in there for the record.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Get it in there. I'm going to close the loop too for you...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So Socrates - you were correct.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...!

**Adam Stacoviak:** It says "The philosopher most famously known for being against writing things down is Socrates."

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. I got it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Through his student Plato's writings, Socrates expressed concerns that writing weakens memory, and can lead to a false appearance of knowledge, rather than true understanding." And it goes on to say that he believed that writing was not an effective means of communicating knowledge.

**Jerod Santo:** He was saying that from a place of privilege, though. He had Plato to write all the stuff down for him.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on. Yeah. Right?

**Jerod Santo:** Some of us plebs have to write our own things down...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It was about being face to face, it seems. It says "To him, face to face communication was the only way one person could transmit knowledge to another."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It seems a little one-sided... Now, see - here's the thing, though, is that world was so much different.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The amount of things you could know about was so finite compared to now.

**Jerod Santo:** When did he live?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't even know. Forever ago.

**Jerod Santo:** 470 BC.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh, so...

**Jerod Santo:** I just feel like I asked that question so I could tell you... I didn't. I actually was typing it in.

**Adam Stacoviak:** If you predate Jesus, it's a long time ago, right? I mean, come on...

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. But I get this, you know? When I'm communicating with somebody who is -- I don't know, let's say they might be an idiot, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Present company excluded...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, not you. No, definitely not. Nobody on the Changelog platform, as far as I'm concerned.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair.

**Mat Ryer:** And I want to just go on the record saying that. No, but it's kind of a nice clue when you're texting with somebody or talking to them - like, you get clues about what's going on. And you sort of lose a bit of that if things are augmented. But we want everyone to be their best version, surely, and we want everyone to have the best chance... So I've got to come down on the side of that. And there's Apple Intelligence adverts that show -- this one guy, and he just like normally would say "Yeah, light it up. Yeah, I'm walking here!" That kind of character.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Mat Ryer:** And then Apple Intelligence changes it to be "Oh, I believe I was traversing the walkway before your vehicle approached..." You know, it changes it into something that sounds --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I had to interrupt this amazing story due to not paying for software. Loopback has introduced some noise, because we needed to use loopback to combine your piano and your microphone into a single one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, there's a loopback going on.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And because you haven't paid for it - which I'm cool with; they are not. That's the problem.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, it's on purpose.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's on purpose.

**Jerod Santo:** That's cheeky. So I'm remembering this now. Adam, good job of identifying this. This is a good -- it's not shareware. What is it called? It's like trialware \[unintelligible 00:12:06.22\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Destructiveware.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:12:09.22\] Yeah, it's kind of annoying.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can use it, but it will destroy your work.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe right here we can insert one of those "A few minutes later..." and then we come back.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[A few minutes later...\]

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We are now back from the noisiness of Loopback, and - destructiveware. You were saying that. What were you saying?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, first of all, I don't know if Loopback need to be doing that. I get it, free trial, and then you want to pay for it... But it's a bit cheeky, isn't it? What did it sound like to you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** The worst.

**Jerod Santo:** White noise? Just like really loud white noise.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. It progressed and got louder and louder, to the point we couldn't hear you at all.

**Jerod Santo:** I think they should give you like a seven-day or a 30-day -- I mean, that was like a 45-minute trial. Maybe less.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, probably less.

**Jerod Santo:** But we are fans of Rogue Amoeba software, but not necessarily that particular move they did right there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that was not cool.

**Jerod Santo:** And whatever story you were telling, Mat... I'm sure it was hilarious.

**Mat Ryer:** I don't remember now. Do you?

**Jerod Santo:** I don't either. Should we just move on?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think we should. Yeah, let's move on to the good stuff. Here we go.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's tell each other some lies.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh. I've got a lie for you.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to do these? Now, let's explain what we're doing here, Mat. Mat, this was your idea. It's similar to a game I play on JS Party called HeadLies, where I do a similar thing, except for it's just one person... So I'm very excited, because I've never actually gotten to participate. I've always been just the host. And today I'm a participant. So take us away, Mat. This was your idea. What are we going to do?

**Mat Ryer:** So we've got two truths and one lie. And these are tech headlines.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** So we have to say the three, and then you've got to be able to figure out which is the lie, and which ones are the truths.

**Jerod Santo:** So each of us has brought three. And we'll each go in turn telling all three. And then the other two people have to try to detect the lie. Do you want to go first? You're the guest. Be our guest.

**Mat Ryer:** "AI has created new proteins that didn't exist before." That's number one.

**Jerod Santo:** That's number one?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Number two, "A train in China has broken the sound barrier."

**Jerod Santo:** These are headlines? These seem like summaries...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, that's what a headline is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I know, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, sometimes. Okay, keep going.

**Adam Stacoviak:** My version of this is not the same...

**Mat Ryer:** What's your preferred news outlet? I'll try and adapt it to that style.

**Jerod Santo:** The BBC, obviously.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, keep going.

**Mat Ryer:** And then number three, "AI has actually created a new color." Again, that was a summary, not a...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so AI has created new proteins...

**Mat Ryer:** A new protein. There's a super-fast train in China...

**Jerod Santo:** AI has created a new color...

**Mat Ryer:** A brand new color that's never been thought of before.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Okay, and then the train one - I think that one's true.

**Mat Ryer:** It's going faster than the speed of sound.

**Jerod Santo:** That is not that hard. There's cars that have done it.

**Mat Ryer:** It's quite fast, though...

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, a train doing that is significant... But you know, it's China. They've got --

**Adam Stacoviak:** How fast is the sound barrier? \[unintelligible 00:15:11.15\]

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds like a question for a robot, not a human.

**Mat Ryer:** I think it's about 700 miles an hour, from memory. But I could be wrong. I mean --

**Jerod Santo:** Is that right? Maybe cars haven't done it. Planes have done it, not cars.

**Adam Stacoviak:** 770, approximately.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I take that back. I don't think a car has ever done that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** 1239 kilometers per hour. That's cool.

**Mat Ryer:** Quite fast.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe those cars out in the desert, where they're just like...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I think they have broken it. I'm just waffling back and forth...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, the rocket car.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I think they have.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So airplanes definitely break it then. But has a train in China broken it? Probably. I think they would figure that out.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, could be.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so I'm going with "AI has created a new color." I think that's impossible. You just -- all the colors exist, and all you've got to do is get the right hex code.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know about this, Mat...

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:16:03.24\] Hex codes aren't the be all and end all of color, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, for me, they kind of are. Oh, you're more of an HSL guy?

**Mat Ryer:** Hey, did you know that the yellow that you look at on a screen is a lie? It's not the same as yellow if you're looking at a yellow flower.

**Jerod Santo:** That's why I'm picking that one as a lie.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I just -- I don't trust colors. Adam, what are you thinking?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Man, I'm still just thinking about these trains breaking the sound barrier... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe they haven't.

**Mat Ryer:** It'd be loud, wouldn't it? Imagine waiting for a train and that one zooms past and bursts your ears.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's the one I think is a lie. I think that's the lie one.

**Jerod Santo:** You think the train one's a lie?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I think the train one's a lie.

**Jerod Santo:** So you and I both agree that "AI created a new protein" sounds like something that they would be doing with it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Totally plausible. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** What about "AI created a new color?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** Totally plausible.

**Jerod Santo:** How so? Don't all colors exist and they just need to be hex-coded?

**Mat Ryer:** Or just need to be discovered...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I think it's a discovery thing. I mean, invent and discover is --

**Jerod Santo:** He did say invent.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, okay. Well...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but I gave a summary, not a headline.

**Jerod Santo:** Clearly you didn't give a headline.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The train is the lie.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so Adam's going with train. I'm going with color. Mat, is there some sort of like a prelude song that you'd play on the way up to this?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, probably. I would have thought so. \[singing\] "Have you ever considered a super-fast train? How about one that'll blow your ears out and destroy your brain? Yeah, it's super-loud, baby. Loud... And that one was true."

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...!

**Mat Ryer:** Congratulations. That one was true. I'm afraid... \[singing\] "The color of a blooming... Thing... As Jerod said, the colors all exist."

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...!

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** "So it can't be that one... Adam looks pissed, but he's fine. He's fine..."

**Jerod Santo:** Love it.

**Mat Ryer:** Congratulations!

**Adam Stacoviak:** I will concede that it's very -- it's more plausible for the train to have broken the sound barrier than it would be to invent a new color. However, I thought I had some prior knowledge to the Shinkansen, which is the most famous bullet train.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And I knew its max speed because my son was such a fan of trains when he was growing up, like three, four, five; still is a fan... But we actually studied high-speed trains for a while. Like, just for fun, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** At like a four-year-old level, not like an academic level.

**Jerod Santo:** And none of them had broken the sound barrier.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, none of them did, and they were all like the 400 range. So 700 and something is quite faster than 400, obviously... And imagine a train -- here's the thing with this speed train that you've got to think about... You have to consider so much further in the distance the dangers that are there. If you've got passengers on these trains... That's the whole point of them, they're passenger trains. And you go from here to there really, really fast. It's like, the time to break or the time to stop is so much distance that you have to have like the proper railway to have this distance, and stuff. So I just thought it was like less likely. I thought, "Well, you know... Find a color. Pick color."

**Jerod Santo:** Plus you won't hear it coming, you know?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Mat Ryer:** No, because it's faster than sound.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. It beats the sound to you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's actually -- I don't believe so. I think you would still hear it coming.

**Jerod Santo:** I was just joking. I also think you'll hear it. But you'll hear it a little bit later than it would arrive.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Delayed. Yeah, I was going to say, delayed. They can't hear themselves. Could you hear yourself going too fast? If you're going faster than sound, could you hear yourself?

**Mat Ryer:** Inside the train, the air is not moving that fast, I suppose. So they'll be fine. But yeah, if you were just traveling that fast...

**Jerod Santo:** There's weird physics around that, right? If you're in a moving vehicle and you throw a baseball up in the air, you can catch it. But then if you throw it out of it, then it still travels -- I don't know how it works, but you start to break your brain thinking about that...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Wind resistance there. Friction elsewhere.

**Jerod Santo:** There's inertia, there's wind resistance... There's lots of things going on.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Because the ball is traveling at that speed as well, relative to you.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. It's starting place is already that speed.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It's already going dead fast, even if you're holding it.

**Jerod Santo:** But you don't notice it. Much like us. We're like turning around on this globe at like - how many miles per hour? But we have no idea.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:20:23.20\] Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Seven. I think it was seven miles per hour we're traveling around the world.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's not that fast.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, one day per hour. No, one hour per hour.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Finally, I landed on something closely correlated and true. Okay, I have my two truths and a lie...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** And let's see if you all can guess which one is the lie. Number one. Now, these are going to read more like headlines, because you know, I follow directions around here... But that's neither here nor there. Number one, "As TikTok ban looms, Meta is sponsoring TikTok posts that encourage US users to migrate to Instagram." That's number one.

Number two, "Developer fires entire team for AI, now ends up searching for engineers on LinkedIn." Number three, Miyamoto's son -", this is Nintendo's Miyamoto... "Miyamoto's son was so bad at SuperMario 64 that he questioned his parenting." There you have it. Two truths and one lie. What are you guys thinking?

**Mat Ryer:** That first one sounded long for a headline...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, now you're judging mine, after those summaries you provided...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you know headlines have skewed more conversational in the last five years...

**Mat Ryer:** I think I know the answer to this, but Adam, what do you think?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Can I hear them again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** "As TikTok ban looms, Meta is sponsoring TikTok posts that encourage US users to migrate to Instagram." Number two, "Developer fires entire team for AI, now ends up searching for engineers on LinkedIn." Number three, "Miyamoto's son was so bad at Super-Mario 64, he questioned his parenting."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Man, they're all terrible.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** They're all terrible.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, but which one is not true? Two of those are true, by the way.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Two of those are true. I'm thinking the last one's not true.

**Jerod Santo:** Miyamoto's son?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I don't know why... I can't give any more credence to AI here in this podcast so far... Although - we'll see.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I'm going to go with that one though, the AI one... Because I can't say AI, but what I can do is spot when Jerod's been a cheeky monkey...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** I think it's a joke. It's quite funny that someone would fire all their team, and then -- do they use AI to search LinkedIn for people, though, at least, probably?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you could read the rest of the article on techgig.com... Because I got that headline from techgig.com. That is a true headline. You are both -- well, sorry. Oh, no. I foreshadowed. You are both incorrect. It's not Miyamoto's son. It's not LinkedIn. The lie is "As TikTok ban looms, Meta is sponsoring TikTok posts and encourages US users to migrate to Instagram." I made that up!

**Mat Ryer:** Well, that could easily be true, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Actually, it's kind of a good idea.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If TikTok would let them.

**Jerod Santo:** Or maybe they are doing it, but no one wrote the headline.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Anyways, I feel bad for you guys, sort of... Like, I just hoodwinked you...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** That's the game, though.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam looks doubly mad...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just angry about most things, you know?

**Mat Ryer:** But that's the game, Jerod. Don't feel bad. Do you feel bad in Monopoly when you're like taking money off your kids?

**Jerod Santo:** Honestly, Mat, when I tell people I feel bad when I'm beating them in a game, it's -- I'm not really feeling bad. I just say that because I just feel like it's the appropriate thing.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's sweet.

**Jerod Santo:** So...

**Mat Ryer:** That's a lie then. I vote that one as the lie.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:23:57.26\] \[laugh\] Finally, he gets one right. Okay, Adam, why don't you do your turn, and share with us some truths and lies?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm bringing one close to home, really...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...that goes back to Mat's world, in a way. I've got three headlines... Two that are true, and then one that's false.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's interesting. \[unintelligible 00:24:20.17\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just so you're aware.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Okay, okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Which order should I read them in? Should I read the true ones first, or the false one first?

**Jerod Santo:** Read the false one first...

**Mat Ryer:** You have to mix it up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, here we go.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] If you read the false one first, I'm sure to get it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is the false one, just so you know. "US nuclear arsenal relied on eight-inch floppy disks until 2019."

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, wow...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Number two. "Scientists used slime molds to help design Tokyo's rail system." Number three, "Raspberry Pi is due to announce an SBC-style GPU to compete with Nvidia."

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Good.

**Jerod Santo:** So can you say the middle one again? Slime molds?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. "Scientists used slime molds to help design Tokyo's rail system."

**Mat Ryer:** Don't know what either one of them is.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't either. I'm not sure what slime molds are. Like slime, from Ghostbusters slime?

**Mat Ryer:** Slimer?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. What do you think they got him in to help consult?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've got headlines only. I've got no context here, okay? These are headlines only.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm just trying to figure out if it's real or not, you know? If it's Ghostbusters-based, I'm going to assume it's a lie.

**Mat Ryer:** It's like, sorry we're late on the project, but hiring Slimer was a big mistake. \[unintelligible 00:25:39.24\] contributed nothing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I won't tell you this, but I'll give you the details later, and you're going to love this. I've got more context.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, he's going to give us details later. So that one, he's got an actual article. I've ruled it out. That's true.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Which one's true?

**Jerod Santo:** Slime molds.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Because you've just said you have an article on it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I didn't say on that one. I was saying on another one. That was a whole different one.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you just changed the subject and then told us you had information?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I was thinking about something different. I was contextually somewhere else, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. What was the first one again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, yes "US - United States - US nuclear arsenal." You know where the United States is too, right, Jerod? You know where's that, the US? Okay. Mat, do you know where it's at?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but I thought you were just saying us, because you're from there...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, just us.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Us. "Us nuclear arsenal relied on --"

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] It is bad that you call your country "us".

**Adam Stacoviak:** Here we go. Oh, it's like AI.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's kind of appropriate, isn't it? I mean...

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Us nuclear arsenal relied on eight-inch floppy disks until 2019."

**Jerod Santo:** Eight-inch floppy disks. Those are the big ones.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Not even the save icon, is it that?

**Jerod Santo:** No, no, no. In fact --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that won't work for you.

**Jerod Santo:** How far does the eight-inch go back? Because I remember floppies, but I never used an eight-inch. It was always a three and a half inch.

**Mat Ryer:** I have handled an eight-inch one. I have had one in my hand, and they are floppy. This is where the name floppy disk came from, because I understood from the three and a half inch ones they weren't floppy. They were rock hard, because they were plastic, as a plastic card, I suppose. They weren't made of rocks.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** But the bigger ones, the eight-inch ones - I think they were eight inch - they were actually floppy. Actually, no. I'm thinking five and a half. I don't think I've seen eight either.

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, it's a big old disk.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It's big. You can do some damage with that. I wonder what capacity, and how much you could get in.

**Jerod Santo:** Probably less than the five, and the half and three and a half.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, probably. I hope so. No, I don't know, because it was that direction of travel, wasn't it?

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. But I think they got better at density, or something. You know, smaller storage space over time...

**Mat Ryer:** I could easily be using it for some reason in an old antiquated nuclear something...

**Adam Stacoviak:** For the viewing audience... Jason, we can splice this and we'll see... This is a visual; audio audience only, I'm sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** Just imagine what eight inch, five and a quarter, and three and a half looks like.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm screen-sharing with our friends here, Jerod and Mat... My friends, our friends...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:28:13.10\] Hello...

**Adam Stacoviak:** And on the left, you have the eight inch, in the middle you have the five and a quarter, I believe.

**Jerod Santo:** Five and a quarter, yeah. I was saying five inches. I cut the quarter in there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. And then the three and a half, down at the very far right. And I think you're correct, Mat, saying that that one is more of a plastic card. I think you said plastic card.

**Jerod Santo:** That's the three and a half. Yeah. He said rock hard.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Rock hard.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, compared. I've had the middle one, the five and a quarter... And they were just very floppy.

**Jerod Santo:** Difficult to digest.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Us nuclear arsenal relied on eight inch floppiness." The one on the far left.

**Jerod Santo:** I think that's false. I think you made that up. I mean, eight-inch... But it's a nuclear arsenal; not a nuclear power plant, but arsenal. Like, actually firing nukes.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but they have these antiquated systems, though, don't they? And they don't change them in --

**Jerod Santo:** This is a tough one. What was your third one again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Raspberry Pi, soon to announce SBC style GPU to compete with NVIDIA."

**Jerod Santo:** Now, what's an SBC style GPU?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Single-board computer.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** A single what computer?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, you know, the SBC is like super-cool, because you have this tiny little thing, and it's a single board computer.

**Jerod Santo:** And so they're going to compete with NVIDIA, like you're going to be doing inference on these things, or something?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, I can speculate some, if you'd like... What I would say is like it's probably going to pair up with like the Raspberry Pi type thing... Because the Raspberry Pi doesn't -- it has GPU in it, but it's like not super-amazing. It does some stuff. You could do a media center on it, but you probably can't transcode 4K very well; or at least multiple streams. So I think those things have become popular, and so my guess - if this is true, of course - is that this SBC style GPU will pair up with a Pi to give you more GPU in this fanatic way of doing smaller computers, basically. Versus, let's just say the most recent, the RTX 50 or whatever, 5090 or whatever they've just released... That thing is huge. It's got three fans in it. Like, who wants that? You want a GPU that's smaller, SBC style. I'm not trying to overly sell this or anything, but I'm just saying; this could be a truth.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh yeah, it could be. Exactly. It could be true for -- it's not.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This could be true.

**Mat Ryer:** I think it's not. That's what I'm going to pick as the lie. The Raspberry Pi lie.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's what you're choosing as the lie.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, tell me why.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I can believe the U.S. having some old systems and it still happens to need a big old disc. I don't know, the point of Raspberry Pi is all very low tech, LowFi stuff. They do have some bigger bits, but... I don't know. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe they're trying to diversify.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And you think -- what's the lie for you, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I wrote off the slime molds, because I think you were looking at the article while we were talking about it... Which means I didn't think about it very critically. But I'm still thinking that that's true.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** The Raspberry Pi story is exactly the kind of story that you would make up... So I'm leaning --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I would make up?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** For a game...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, not just for in life \[unintelligible 00:31:21.27\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** But I'm not sure where you'd see a report on the U.S. nuclear system and their floppies. To me, that just seems like -- like, is that a news? Is that news recently?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, to go back to our initiative here, we were told by our new friend here...

**Mat Ryer:** Hello.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...obscure tech headlines. These are clearly obscure tech headlines. And so I scoured the internet...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:31:49.25\] Oh, you're saying that was a headline from 2019.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, it doesn't matter when it came. No, they did this until 2019. It doesn't mean that they -- the news is new.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I just don't understand... Maybe there's like a FOIA request on the nukes...

**Mat Ryer:** Right.

**Jerod Santo:** The documentation on nukes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can't confirm where I've gotten this information, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** I just want to applaud you on your ability to put together three pretty good ones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Whereas you didn't like mine, and I fooled you utterly... I'm liking yours. Mat, I feel like you're about to break into some sort of song. Please do.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, not really, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Please stall for me.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] "Tell me which one's the lie, please..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a mini song. Is there more?

**Mat Ryer:** No, no, no. Well, there's another verse...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like this. Are you a fan of Mario Kart? Oh, no, sorry, not Mario Kart. Mario Party.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. Hang on... I'll just do the second verse. Ready?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] "I said, please..." That was it. It's not great.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that was... That was kind of weak.

**Mat Ryer:** They're not all hits. That was an album track.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Interstitials.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You didn't say please, though...

**Jerod Santo:** I was thinking you'd write something about eight-inch floppies, but we can definitely move on...

**Mat Ryer:** I'm saving that for later. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Which one is the lie?

**Jerod Santo:** If I meta game this and my goal is to win... I won the first round by guessing Mat's, and Adam missing it. I won the second round by fooling both of you. And so if I merely tie in round three, I've kind of taken it all... So I'm gonna go with Mat. I'm going to say the Raspberry Pi is false. You've made that up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's so plausible though, right?

**Jerod Santo:** It's really good, yeah. It's really good. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I actually want -- I want that to be true.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] "Why lie about the Raspberry Pi? Why don't you tell the truth...?"

**Jerod Santo:** Amen!

**Mat Ryer:** "I don't know if you know the rules, but you kind of did it good... Adam, you did."

**Jerod Santo:** Go Adam!

**Mat Ryer:** "You did it good..."

**Break**: \[00:34:18.24\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Here's the thing... This cool, this other truth one, the slime mold, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** What is the slime mold deal?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, so they put bits of food to represent Tokyo's various population centers on a map, and then they let a slime mold, which is supposed to be smart, right? Like, it's genius, basically, which naturally seeks the most effective paths between food sources \[unintelligible 00:36:53.03\] And so this thing determined the network that could be a very plausible, very efficient path.

**Jerod Santo:** What...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** So they use slime molds to help design Tokyo's rail system. This is true.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, to design it. See, I thought they were building it with slime molds.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, it said it, to help design Tokyo's rail system.

**Jerod Santo:** I know, but I didn't pay close enough attention.

**Mat Ryer:** That's amazing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think at a headline level you'd think that they use the slime mold to mold the train track kind of thing...

**Jerod Santo:** That's what I was thinking.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I understand that. And then obviously "Us Nuclear Arsenal rely on eight-inch floppy disks until 2019", this is a recent headline.

**Jerod Santo:** Really?

**Adam Stacoviak:** And the details behind this is that the Air Force finally modernized systems that ran on ancient hardware around 2019... But not before plenty of raised eyebrows in the tech circles.

**Jerod Santo:** Why?

**Mat Ryer:** Because they were using eight-inch floppies.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because they were using eight-inch floppy disks.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, they \[unintelligible 00:37:43.18\]

**Jerod Santo:** Five and a quarter?

**Mat Ryer:** No, they must have jumped up to three and a half inch...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. And then, honestly, I just was like -- I like Raspberry Pi's, they're cool... NVIDIA and GPUs are all the rage... And I just heard a headline. Basically, if you're a CPU maker, you're getting into GPU making. If you're a GPU maker, you're getting into CPU making. NVIDIA has CPUs coming out, and Intel has GPUs coming out. So they're flip-flopping. So what's the other thing out there that's maybe going to do this? Raspberry Pi. And an SBC style GPU, that attaches to these other smaller things would be totally cool.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it would be cool. If they do it within a year, should we come back and take Jerod's points off him then?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I think so. Yeah, we should.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll concede those points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, they're going to hear this, right? They're going to hear this.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. This is pretty much like market research for them.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We should totally be doing this. Like, let's get rid of these 8-inch floppy disks that we were thinking about. And let's do these SBC style GPUs.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's good.

**Jerod Santo:** I think we should take a moment to mourn that 8-inch floppy \*bleep\*.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, it's happened. \[laughter\] It's happened.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Freudian slip...

**Jerod Santo:** 8-inch floppy disk...

**Mat Ryer:** It's happened.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Try it again. \[unintelligible 00:39:04.29\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's a family show, Mat. It's a family show.

**Mat Ryer:** Normally, I'm the one that has to be told that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] The eight-inch floppy disk manufacturer, that company that had the contract forever, that they could just keep selling their floppy disks to the government at some astronomical price, you know? After probably 40 years of that one big contract, they finally had to stop printing money and get a real job.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How many -- what's the N+ on the floppy disks do you think they had?

**Jerod Santo:** N+?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, like how many in reserve do you think they had to have to ensure the US arsenal, the US nuclear arsenal was safe? How many floppy disks?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, they probably didn't think they were going to need it until recent events... And then they're like "You know what? We actually should make sure this stuff works."

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:39:59.01\] Let's get 100 behind this. N + 100, you know?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We've got the one in the drive... We're safe. Then we've got 99 others sitting over there, waiting, just in case.

**Mat Ryer:** I wonder what's on the disk then. Like a code, you think?

**Adam Stacoviak:** A GPG key, or something like that.

**Mat Ryer:** Got to be, isn't it? It's not going to be like source code for the missiles, or something...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, let's speculate this system. What could it actually do? If it ran on this hardware, is it running -- is it like a USB version of a software that runs on the USB, but instead it runs on the floppy?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you used to boot off of a floppy, so maybe it's actually like the...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Boots into memory?

**Mat Ryer:** Right. It boots into memory and then runs off the memory.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right. So this floppy gets put in, the program is accessible, it boots into memory... Boom goes the US arsenal.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The nuclear arsenal.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, probably like that.

**Jerod Santo:** So the eight-inch floppy originally stored 80 kilobytes, in 1971. And then it went up to 256... Eventually maxing out at 1.2 megabytes. The five and a quarter introduced in 1976, single-sided, single density, 160K. And then they figured out double density, 360K. Eventually, they did a double-sided double density, 720K... And then double-sided high-density, 1.2 megabytes. So they finally made their way back up to the eight-inch. Maybe this is why the US nuclears are just like "We're cool with the eight-inch, man."

Three and a half inch introduced in 1980, started at 720K, double-sided high-density, 1.44. That's the most common. And then extra-high-density, 2.88 megabytes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is making me think of a museum. Is there a place in the world where there's a technology museum that isn't somebody's random basement, or some weirdo?

**Jerod Santo:** Absolutely there is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There is?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we were there. I'm not sure if we were there in the building together, Adam, but I've been there. It's in the Valley.

**Mat Ryer:** In San Diego, right? I mean, San Jose.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's called the Computer History Museum. Is that what it's called? It's really cool. I thought we were there together, Adam. Maybe I was there with somebody...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Were we there together? Maybe we were.

**Jerod Santo:** I think we were.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It must be ancient history then.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, there is no ancient computer history, because computers aren't ancient.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We haven't been to San Francisco together, I would say in about eight years... It feels like. At least six.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. If you go to computerhistory.org...

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, it's the Computer History...

**Jerod Santo:** ...they have actually a pretty cool Instagram as well that I've checked out, where they still post stuff regularly, and they have new stuff coming in... I'm trying to find the actual address of the place to confirm. You were saying it's in San Diego? It's in Mountain View. I think we were there together, Adam. Mountain View, California.

**Mat Ryer:** I've been to Mountain View.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Was that when we were out to see user testing, maybe?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that might be right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** My brain was a little scattered. We were doing something brand new, with high stakes, so...

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:43:04.04\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laugh\] Yeah, totally.

**Mat Ryer:** That's what you can't remember.

**Jerod Santo:** No, he said high stakes. Oh, wait. That still works.

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:43:10.25\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, high stakes is where you go afterwards. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I did have some other Raspberry Pi lies...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, let's hear them.

**Mat Ryer:** Do we need a theme tune for Raspberry Pi lies?

**Jerod Santo:** Raspberry Pi lies writes itself.

**Mat Ryer:** It does, doesn't it, really? Let's see if it does. What key should it be in? Pick a key, any key.

**Adam Stacoviak:** A P. It should be in P.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's not one. That's not one key.

**Jerod Santo:** How about A minor?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That's A minor. What do you think, Adam? Higher or lower?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Uh, higher, always, as you know. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** He likes high stakes.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] "I want my Raspberry Pi lies, baby, feed them to me. I want to think that they're making GPUs, and gonna sell themselves to China. Tell me where we're gonna be in a thousand years time... But tell me through Raspberry Pi lies..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:44:21.20\] Well, they weren't really full-on lies. They were more like directions that I didn't flesh out. So I was thinking...

**Mat Ryer:** "They're more like directions that I was fleshing out... So I was thinking..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was thinking drones, like a Pico drone. Like make your own drone from a Pi.

**Jerod Santo:** Like a Pico drone.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** I want that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And then I was thinking -- like, something solar, because I was like "Well, these things are so small... You want them to be in obscure places." Like, what if I wanted a switch? Like a WRT switch that's running open source stuff, that's not like power-accessible. Have a battery, maybe, or like a power pack... What if it was solar power, you know? So I was thinking like something solar, that direction.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's about it.

**Mat Ryer:** I'd have gone for the US military disks, if you'd said either of those two.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true.

**Adam Stacoviak:** But then I was thinking "Well, GPU... That's in the headlines now. It's CES recent, so..." There you go. Boom.

**Jerod Santo:** The challenge with solar is you need so much surface area.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, if it's small, though... Let's say if it's sub five watts, which is what it would probably be like; probably sub two watts. It's just a switch, and maybe Wi-Fi.

**Jerod Santo:** How much surface area do you need for that?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Probably not much. I mean, the size of a Pi, probably... Pi solar. Could you imagine this Pi solar? Raspberry Pi, if you're not listening to this podcast for ideas...

**Mat Ryer:** You should be.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, you should be. Yeah. I mean, here you go.

**Mat Ryer:** I like the drone idea. I kind of want a phone case that's got that on it, so if I do find I've lost my phone around the flat, I can press a button on my watch... Yeah, and it just flies to me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that'd be cool.

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, it might slice some people on the way...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, there's some really small drones out there. So back I want to say about six or so years ago, maybe seven years ago, in the early days of drones... They were expensive. They still kind of are expensive now. But there was these really small ones you could buy on Amazon, and they're like tiny, little toy things. So I'm thinking that'd be kind of cool, to build a drone from a Pi... But you probably can do that already, you know? All you need is a case, and compute. And then I suppose servos and stuff like that to do the motors.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, you just need a good old fast fan.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. One fan, go up \[unintelligible 00:46:47.20\] What's next? Is this show just based on truths and lies? Is there more?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, we finished, haven't we?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I won.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Is this the show?

**Mat Ryer:** Jerod, you won that, didn't you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I would say that I should get some points too, because I let you win. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, you can have some of Mat's points.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I mean, I don't need them.

**Jerod Santo:** He's not going to use them.

**Mat Ryer:** I can't spend them in this country. The exchange rate is terrible for points on game shows. That's why you don't get many Brits appearing on American shows...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** We should have prizes, and then just give them to me at the end.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If you win.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What can we give as a prize? Well, I'll tell you what, Jerod - you can master this episode. How about that?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** There you go.

**Mat Ryer:** That's nice.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It'd be fun.

**Jerod Santo:** I can do that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It'd be fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe I'll put in some applause, and congratulation sounds, maybe like that confetti... You know that one?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** We should reach out to Loopback though, and Rogue Amoeba, to see if they want to sponsor the show...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:47:51.25\] They should. We should have an episode that's just white noise, until the check clears...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "This show, brought to you by Rogue Amiba."

**Jerod Santo:** "Brought to you by shhhhhh-", you know?

**Mat Ryer:** It's a shame it's that sound. It could have been a lovely little ditty, or a Snoop Dogg track...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'll tell you what --

**Jerod Santo:** Well, the licensing fees, you know...

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...I do think it'd be kind of cool to augment whatever's being done. And like if you were speaking, now you're not Mat, now you're Snoop Dogg, what you said, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Or they could do the Charlie Brown parent thing... Like, you just are "Wah, wah, wah, wah..." That would actually be pretty cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That'd actually be kind of funny.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good marketing, because you could probably use it like an unintended consequence. Next thing you know, like --

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Or bad marketing, because people won't upgrade. They're just like "I want the Charlie Brown sound, so I'm gonna keep it."

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. "Well, where'd you get that?" "Well, this free trial of Rogue Amoeba software called Loopback. Just go get it. It's free." That'd be cool. \[laughter\] That's good marketing. More ideas for these people...! \[unintelligible 00:48:47.18\]

**Jerod Santo:** I know... Well, you're an idea guy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, man...

**Break**: \[00:48:54.24\]

**Jerod Santo:** One other thing we could talk about was - just to throw some flowers at Mat, in addition to your amazing piano skills... I hear you recently won an award yourself, didn't you?

**Mat Ryer:** I did, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Can you tell us about this?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Is this true or is it a lie?

**Mat Ryer:** No, this is true. I couldn't believe it.

**Jerod Santo:** I was gonna have you tell the story and have Adam guess, but you've already ruined it. This is true.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I've said it's true. I mean, if I was lying, that is what I would say, to be fair...

**Jerod Santo:** Yea, that it's true.

**Mat Ryer:** I have ruined it. It is true.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:51:49.00\] Yeah, it's completely ruined. Go ahead, tell us the story.

**Mat Ryer:** This was the OpenUK, which is an organization that works and celebrates open source software... And I think because of a little package I wrote with a friend of mine called Testify - you may have heard of it... Have you heard of it, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I do declare. It's a version of testifying.

**Jerod Santo:** That is. Declaring, testifying...

**Mat Ryer:** He has voided the answer. Cool.

**Jerod Santo:** You know I've heard of it, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Have you?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, from you, on GoTime.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I don't stop banging on about it, to be honest...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you just won't shut up about it.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Actually, what I've found out from Jonathan Amsterdam, from the Go team at Google - it's the most imported Go package in the world, by about three times, or something.

**Jerod Santo:** Wow.

**Mat Ryer:** So it's like an assertion package that helps you assert equal...

**Jerod Santo:** Write some tests.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it helps you with your testing.

**Jerod Santo:** Doesn't Go have that stuff built in?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, it deliberately doesn't. And what you're told to do, really, by the Go team is to write native Go code, and that's your test. And there's nothing new for someone to learn...

**Jerod Santo:** And you don't want to do that.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I just wasn't used to it... And I was used to this assertion library. And it turns out -- I mean, it's the most imported Go package by three times, or whatever... It turns out, I think, people want that. But there's a weird little rub around when you pass variables into methods. In certain cases, it can change. You don't really want that happening in your test suite stuff.

**Jerod Santo:** Isn't that called shadowing, or something like this?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Is this like a Go Piccadilly, or is this a programming thing?

**Mat Ryer:** It's a Go-specific Piccadilly.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. \[laughs\] Did I use that word right?

**Mat Ryer:** I have no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** I doubt it.

**Jerod Santo:** Probably not... I've been using words wrong all day.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Maybe you meant Piccalilly, which is \[unintelligible 00:53:42.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** Perhaps.

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:53:45.25\] But it's real yellow, and not fake computer yellow... Unless you're seeing it on a computer.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you can't be trusted any longer. You've been telling these...

**Mat Ryer:** You can't trust yellow. No, no.

**Jerod Santo:** Now I'm just googling Piccadilly, see if it's a real thing...

**Mat Ryer:** It's a place in London. There's an area.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that's right. It's like a square.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Isn't it a square?

**Mat Ryer:** No, it's a circus.

**Jerod Santo:** What's a circus? A circus is where the elephants are.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So there's a circus in London...

**Mat Ryer:** Called...

**Jerod Santo:** Piccadilly.

**Mat Ryer:** Piccadilly. That's it.

**Jerod Santo:** And this is where like elephants stand on their two heels, and then lions jump through?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It's a very popular tourist attraction.

**Jerod Santo:** Is it a circle?

**Mat Ryer:** It's not really like much of a circle, but it probably was originally.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Is that what a circus is? A circle?

**Mat Ryer:** I've only put that together talking to you now.

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, let me just say, the US audience here - we don't know what a circus is, unless it's Barnum and Bailey's.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's the best circus in the world.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. So you're not doing a very good job of explaining why Piccadilly is a circus.

**Mat Ryer:** No, I can't help it.

**Jerod Santo:** You also called it a place.

**Mat Ryer:** A place.

**Jerod Santo:** So we're very confused. Adam, are you confused?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm also confused, about something else. So tell me if you know this URL... GitHub.com...

**Jerod Santo:** I do.

**Mat Ryer:** Yup. Yup. I've heard of that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Slash \[unintelligible 00:55:02.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** Say what?

**Mat Ryer:** Nearly...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Does that ring a bell to you, Mat?

**Mat Ryer:** Stretchr.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Stretchr.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, is this Testify?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That's the startup that we had when we made Testify. So we put it in the company name... Not my own personal name. Now I'd be world-famous, had I...

**Jerod Santo:** You already are. You won an open source award.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. I forgot -- I didn't finish telling you that. I got a medal... They sent me a medal.

**Jerod Santo:** What color was it?

**Mat Ryer:** Golden.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, golden. That's first place.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I think everyone gets that though. It wasn't like a race... But there you go. So yeah, it was the Open UK Honours, New Year's Honours list. And genuinely, it is quite nice to get that. Normally I don't win things like that, but... Quite honoured to get it, really.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:55:55.17\] What do you think is that stretchr.com, spelled this funny way? S-T-R-E-T-C-H-R.com. What do you think is there?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I know that we let the domain expire, and someone else got it. So...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's why I was confused. Like, what do these folks have to do with Testify for Go? Because it's a stretching company. Like, you go there and you get stretched.

**Mat Ryer:** What's that? What do you mean you get stretched...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** So I was thinking like "Mat, what is going on with your software?" What did you write this for to be stretched?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, originally this was like a MongoDB style API, so for web and app developers; you'd be able to just start posting data to RESTful endpoints. They didn't have to exist. And it would create the RESTful -- you know, the data, it would just persist it, and then when you'd get it, and get the list, and it would all just work. So that was the idea, to make development quicker, and it gives you like a backend... So kind of like a schema-less data store thing. And the idea was --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, you're describing what your idea was, not this stretching idea they've got.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I see.

**Mat Ryer:** From what you've said, it sounds like they're going to stretch you, like Stretch Armstrong, or something.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, they're doing something different altogether.

**Mat Ryer:** But I need to make sure that that domain name is not on the project.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It is. That's how I found it. It's on the GitHub organization...

**Mat Ryer:** I'm going to go and change that right now.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I would definitely change that, because that's confusing. I don't think anybody cares... I guess actually three times as many other folks who download or install any packages - or whatever you call them - in their Go programs and software, they care. But they're not on your org, looking at what URL goes back to the source for Stretchr.

**Mat Ryer:** No, but it is a concern. And I checked the emails to make sure that there were no emails that were, you know...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I would do this, though. I would first email these folks at the new Stretchr, and I would let them know that you've been promoting their stuff for a few years now, and that there's royalties to be paid.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I'd let them know that first, prior to -- and take a screenshot and share that with them, and then say "I've since stopped, but you owe me backpay."

**Mat Ryer:** Maybe I could take that payment in stretches. So they could just come and just --

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. "I'm willing to barter. I could use a stretch."

**Jerod Santo:** A body stretch. Can I close the loop on Piccadillos?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Please do.

**Jerod Santo:** Have you ever seen the movie Good Will Hunting?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, at least once.

**Jerod Santo:** So Robin Williams character, Sean, tells Will this story about how his wife farts in her sleep.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah, she farts.

**Jerod Santo:** And will cracks up about it. Sometimes she farts so loud she wakes herself up.

**Mat Ryer:** Alright. Yeah. I've done that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. And they're laughing about it... And Sean says "That's the stuff that I remember", because she's dead, right?

And that's not a spoiler, because that's like the start of the plot. So trailer spoiler -- can you have a trailer spoiler? It's probably in the trailer. Trailer spoiler... Okay. And he says "That's the stuff I remember, the fact that she farted in her sleep", which is funny. \[Little things like that, that happened. Those are the things I miss the most. Those little idiosyncrasies that only I know about. That's what made her my wife... Only she had the goods on me, too. She knew all my little Piccadillos.\] And he goes on from there. He's referring to idiosyncrasies, and he uses the word Piccadillos. And I just assumed that that was a word. But I can't find that word anywhere else except for when Robin Williams said it... As you two were talking about stretching or something, I'm not sure what you guys were talking about.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How would you spell that, in your version of it, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I spelled it like Piccadillo Square -- or sorry, Circus. Or Circle. And that was wrong. But according to this website here called Wikiquote, it's spelled P-E-C-C-A-D-I-L-L-O-S.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:59:58.22\] But you sort of know what it means, even though it's not a word.

**Jerod Santo:** You totally know what it means. Actually, it is a word, I was probably just spelling it wrong. "A small sin or a fault, a slight trespass or offense. A petty crime, a trifling fault." So that's what I was talking about with Go. It was like this little sin of Go, shadowing variables and stuff...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on...

**Mat Ryer:** I see.

**Jerod Santo:** And not having built-in test assertions.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Well, the Go team -- actually, Testify is banned at Google.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, is it? And you don't use it anymore. I know that.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I do use it because there's lots of projects that use it.

**Jerod Santo:** But not in new stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I don't. Because I just have a smaller version, which is on my own GitHub, just called is. And it's just like three or four methods. Testify has so much power in it. It's one of those things where if you're a pro user and you're doing a lot of testing, Testify is for you.

**Jerod Santo:** And it's super-popular, so probably a bunch of people came by and added their own little peccadillos...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. And they fixed it, so now there's armadillos in it... Everything.

**Jerod Santo:** All kinds of dillos. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So many dillos...

**Mat Ryer:** Actually, we did have the policy -- we had a policy of anybody that contributed to PR was added to the project. So this was like an experiment, really, which I probably regret, only because it meant that it just blew up, it ballooned. The API is enormous.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Now, did they get awards too, or what happened there? Did you even mention them?

**Mat Ryer:** Who?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who?

**Mat Ryer:** Mention who?

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know who I've slandered there, because I genuinely didn't hear it...

**Jerod Santo:** Mat, when you took this open source award, this medal, this gold medal, did you mention all the little people that helped you along the way? All these contributors?

**Adam Stacoviak:** The peccadillos...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Of course I did. I mean, I didn't give a speech anywhere, but I said it to myself out loud in the mirror.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, there wasn't a speech? This wasn't like an award show, or something?

**Mat Ryer:** No, it's just...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, man. I was hoping to put the footage up, and stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** That'd be nice. Well, we could make that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's do it right now.

**Jerod Santo:** You should do an acceptance speech that we could send to them. Oh, that's a lot of pressure...

**Mat Ryer:** This is good.

**Jerod Santo:** You could sing it.

**Mat Ryer:** Now, I would have improvised it anyway...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Mat, here is your award for being great in open source. Go.

**Mat Ryer:** Wow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who do you want to thank?

**Mat Ryer:** I just want to thank all the little people first... They're tiny, or they're really far away. Either way... But they've helped. And you don't have to have contributed a lot to open source, like I have with Testify, the most important project in the world, I think... Jerod, were those your words?

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe...

**Mat Ryer:** But thank you very much for this lovely medal. And I'd like to thank all my family as well... I'm holding it because it came with a ribbon, so I'm just holding it up. Yeah. And keep open-sourcing, everyone. Bye! That sort of thing.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That sort of thing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Not bad.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, if you had to do that in song, for instance, what would that sound like?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I'd only have one hand, because I'm holding the medal.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, just go strong hand only...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Hold my strong hand..."

**Mat Ryer:** Hold my strong hand... \[singing\] "I want to thank all the little people... I don't know why you're so tiny... But you helped me make this project by typing things in on your tiny keyboard... Oh, baby, one day you'll be big...! Thank you for my award, thank you for my award... Thank you for my lovely medal..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Speaking of medals, Jerod, were you referencing, like I was, Scary Movie 2?

**Jerod Santo:** At which point?

**Adam Stacoviak:** When you said "Take my strong hand."

**Jerod Santo:** No, I was laughing at you, because I know you said that previously during a \#define game after Taylor Troesh gave you that little hand at Strange Loop...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:04:11.28\] That's right. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** And you held the little hand up and you said "Take my strong hand." I was laughing because I knew that was a callback, and I knew Mat didn't know that was a callback, so I was also laughing for that reason...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Still got it. I've still got my hand.

**Jerod Santo:** He still has his -- there it is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Take my strong hand..."

**Jerod Santo:** So this is this is a Scary Movie 2 quote?

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's actually a Mandela effect.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, it's not actually in there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, people largely -- I'm talking like a massive population... Strongly, emphatically believe that he said "Take my strong hand."

**Jerod Santo:** Who?

**Adam Stacoviak:** In the in the movie.

**Jerod Santo:** He.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'd have to show you the clip. I don't know the person's name.

**Jerod Santo:** But he actually said what?

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Take my little hand."

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Why the hell do they think he said strong then?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Exactly. Mandela effect, bro.

**Jerod Santo:** But why?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know why Mandela effect happens. It just does.

**Mat Ryer:** Huh.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, a lot of people believe. I mean, there's a lot of people who -- I believe it. I remember that.

**Jerod Santo:** You just told us he said that like five minutes ago.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I know, but he didn't. The truth is that he said "Take my little hand."

**Jerod Santo:** Huh.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "You take my little hand."

**Jerod Santo:** I didn't know a lot of people watched that movie and had commentary on it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a lot of people. Yeah, it's a very popular unpopular film. I mean, it's Scary Movie 2.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on. It's a sequel.

**Jerod Santo:** That's exactly my point. You're making my point for me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on now.

**Jerod Santo:** I could imagine you saying -- you know, when Darth Vader says "Luke, I am your father", he never says that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, that's a shame, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** And that's a shame; that's what everybody thinks he said.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Why? So why does everybody else believe that?

**Jerod Santo:** It's the Mandela effect.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The Mandela effect.

**Jerod Santo:** Because it's kind of like what he should have said if George Lucas was a slightly better writer...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I love that compression, though. You don't have to explain anything besides Mandela effect. That's just it.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's the beauty of memes and compression.

**Mat Ryer:** But Mandela did exist, right? He's not part of the Mandela effect, is he?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, he's the inventor of it, unbeknownst to him.

**Jerod Santo:** Are we talking about Nelson Mandela? Who are we talking about?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nelson Mandela. Yeah. So to my knowledge - this is what I know about it. The Mandela effect came about because there was a large - again, a large population of people who emphatically believed that he had passed away years before he did not pass away. So he passed away much later, truthfully, but people believed he had died many, many years before that. And there's a lot of people, and they're like "I remember seeing the headline. I remember seeing the news reports" etc. Meanwhile, he did not. And so this birthed this, I suppose, the name to the phenomenon that seems to have happened throughout history, where a large population misremembers or has memory of an alternate dimension.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Now, if you go back to the --

**Jerod Santo:** "Oh, right." Like that was just a totally normal thing to say. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's the thing...? I'm trying to remember what the... If somebody else would be a scientist here, they would know what I'm talking about. There's a place over in your area, Mat, in the European region, I suppose, where they have like these...

**Mat Ryer:** In CERN?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, CERN, this collider. Yeah, yeah. Tell me, what's it called again?

**Mat Ryer:** The CERN particle accelerator.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The CERN particle accelerator. There you go. I like the way he says it. So they believe that when this began to happen, it started to create fractures in timelines, and like alternate realities. Now, I don't know how plausible this is, but it's crazy as it'll get out there. Like, you're smashing particles together, and you're rippling time, and space, and whatever. The Mandela effect, there you go.

**Jerod Santo:** They should have called it the Jimmy Carter effect, because I thought he was dead a long time ago.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Me too.

**Jerod Santo:** It turns out he made it to a hundred.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's why tomorrow I'm not celebrating. Everybody's going to mourning, I'm gonna be like "Listen, the guy had a good life. He died twice."

**Mat Ryer:** \[01:08:04.09\] Yeah, I witnessed one of these. There was a guy - he still is a guy - called Frances Campoy, who is big in the Go community. I think he works at Apple now. Yeah. He's great. I love him, actually. I should text him probably. Yeah, anyway.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Text him right now.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And then while you do that, sing. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And accept the medal. You've never finished your story.

**Mat Ryer:** So we were after some Go conference, and he was talking about seeing Freddie Mercury in Barcelona. And my friend, David Hernandez, who I did the Machine Box project with, he was like "Yes, I was there. I saw that, too." And then there was a guy there who was a big nerd on Queen and Freddie Mercury, and he said "No, he can't have been, because he died the year before."

**Jerod Santo:** Whoa.

**Mat Ryer:** And they're like "No, no, no, no. It was --"

**Adam Stacoviak:** See?

**Mat Ryer:** And they had it. The Mandela effect.

**Jerod Santo:** That's one of those moments where you think that perhaps you're in great harm, you know? Like, you're in harm's way.

**Mat Ryer:** Do you?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it's like a twist at the end, where you're like "Wait a second, the call's coming from inside the house?"

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Like, it couldn't possibly be. He's been dead for years. And you're like \[unintelligible 01:09:15.06\] Because you just had lunch with him, for instance.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right. And you have the refrigerator door open, and as soon as you close it... \[unintelligible 01:09:24.29\]

**Jerod Santo:** Right. And his hook is hanging on the rearview mirror of your truck.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yes. I knew what you did last summer. I knew it! I know what I knew.

**Mat Ryer:** So Freddie...

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my God...

**Jerod Santo:** The two F's.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Both Freddies.

**Jerod Santo:** It reminds me of a song. The one about two R's... How'd that go?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, no. There's no memory. There's no memory.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Double R.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I don't remember it either.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's actually triple. Reading, writing, arithmetic.

**Mat Ryer:** It's good, isn't it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Why is he not singing? We keep prompting him to sing, but he won't do it.

**Mat Ryer:** You know that kid on that movie where Bruce Willis is dead the whole time? Trailer spoiler, and also in the whole film...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** He's dead. He's dead the whole time. And then they show you --

**Adam Stacoviak:** You don't have to watch the movie at all if you know this situation.

**Jerod Santo:** Right, right, right.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. By now, I think that ship has sailed.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm going to go back and rewatch that movie, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a great movie. By the way, if my kids are listening to this, stop right now. Actually, a few seconds before this, because we're going to watch that together. And I don't want them to be spoiled.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** But they love the Mat Ryer episodes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Tell them now to stop listening a minute ago.

**Jerod Santo:** I just did, but... Dang it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's great.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll have to go back in time.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, you can edit that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, you could.

**Jerod Santo:** Edit myself in in the future. Actually, it's in the past. It depends on how you think about it. Okay, but yeah, good movie. I do remember that.

**Mat Ryer:** Jerod, I think you should talk to your kids and not rely on communicating with them through a podcast.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I'll consider it. I'll take it into consideration.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. No, but the little kid's like "I see dead people." And it's like "Yeah, everyone can. You don't go invisible when you die. That's not a film. This is not a film, kid." And if I was Bruce Willis in that, I'd be saying that to him. I'd be like "What are you talking about, mate? Of course you can see dead people."

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Did you see then -- who was it? There was a comedian that told this story about this film...

**Jerod Santo:** Did Mat just take his joke, and act as if it was his own?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, no, no... But it reminds me of it, because they said it was -- oh, it was Nate Bargatze. And we love him, because he's a very tasteful comedian. He doesn't have to cuss, or...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. He's clean, he's hilarious...

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's not saying anything egregious at all. And he said it was more plausible to the listening and watching audience that his wife didn't want to talk to him, than him being dead. \[laughter\] That was a version of his punchline. It was more plausible that this woman was ignoring him for a year, the whole film, basically, ignoring him completely, than for him to be dead.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What a shame.

**Mat Ryer:** No, that's a good point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What a shame.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:12:00.18\] So here's what I would like to have in life. I'd like to have a MatGPT, which is, of course, a musical intelligence that could answer my beck and call. Like, if I had to say "Hey MatGPT, could you summarize this podcast?" Because GPTs can summarize, man.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. They're good at that.

**Jerod Santo:** And sometimes they can summarize in musical fashion, if they happen to be a musical MatGPT.

**Mat Ryer:** I see.

**Jerod Santo:** Could I have one of those?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I think so.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** What key would you like it in? By the way, this is a flex, because you say the key and then I really play it in that key, and then the listening audience \[unintelligible 01:12:34.24\]

**Jerod Santo:** Musical people understand this, but for me it's just more like stress, because I don't know any more keys... I already gave you A minor, and I don't know the other ones. And Adam said P...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was a joke.

**Jerod Santo:** B. Is that a good one? Is that the same as A minor?

**Mat Ryer:** No, it's not the same.

**Adam Stacoviak:** C major?

**Jerod Santo:** Mat, what's the best key for a summary?

**Mat Ryer:** That's a good question. Probably E flat, if we're just being honest...

**Jerod Santo:** Which we haven't been.

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] "Well, thank you for joining us... I hope you had a good time, baby, because I know that I did. I had a lovely time... Now it's time to go and get some R&R... Take it down. Have a relax, and play some SuperMario. If you've got an ancient floppy disk on you, yeah, then you'll be fine when nuclear war breaks out... And if you want to know how to make it out alive, I suggest you get the slime mold to show you how... This is a family show, yeah, but how many kids listen? I don't know... Probably not that many, not yet anyway, not yet anyway... Now, we've had a good time, yeah... We're going for some high stakes after this. I like high stakes. This is my strong hand, take it, please... Take my strong hand, and I'll take you to CERN... And we'll discern if they've broken the Universe. And next time we'll see you on the Changelog & Friends... This is the end... And now for some Loopback white noise..." \[unintelligible 01:15:11.04\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Not bad. Great job, Mat. I actually think, now that you've done that white noise, I think they stole that from you. Yeah, I think they ganked your white noise, bro.

**Jerod Santo:** You should get some licenses from them.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Bye, y'all. Thanks, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Bye! Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** "Take my strong hand..."
