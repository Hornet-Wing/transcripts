**Jerod Santo:** We are here for a friendly... Feud!

**Adam Stacoviak:** So friendly.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, we used to have a game called Frontend Feud. And in fact, Adam, you had a really cool soundbite that you made for us where you said --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** "It's time to play Frontend Feud." I can't do it. But we need a new one for Friendly Feud, so I thought maybe we'd just like live-workshop that here. Do you want to --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sure.

**Jerod Santo:** Give us one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "It's time to play Friendly Feud...!"

**Jerod Santo:** Not bad. Okay, give us three more.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. \[laughter\] One's all you get.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, well, we are here to play Friendly Feud, and we brought some friends with us. In fact, we brought our JS Party people. What's up y'all?

**Kevin Ball:** Hey, Hey.

**Nick Nisi:** Ahoy-hoy.

**Amal Hussein:** Hello, hello.

**Jerod Santo:** To name them and shame them, we have Nick Nisi... You heard that hoy-hoy. We have Kball, Amy is here, and Amal, back from outer space.

**Amal Hussein:** Back from the Loop. I need my own Changelog & Friends show to kind of catch you up with all the things that's been happening in my life...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that would be cool.

**Amal Hussein:** Really. So many -- there's so many good things to dig deep on, I think. But yeah, back-back.

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, b0neskull, Chris Hiller. How are you doing, man?

**Christopher Hiller:** Mm.

**Jerod Santo:** He delivers every time. He delivers every time.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's so exciting.

**Jerod Santo:** The resident curmudgeon. Well, Friendly Feud is a game not of wits, but of... Vibrating? I don't know, your job is to answer these questions in the same way that our audience already answered these questions. So maybe you took our Friendly Feud survey - you probably did; we had almost 200 people take it - and we asked a whole bunch of questions, and now we're going to see which team can accurately figure out what our audience thinks.

So our teams today are divided as thus. We have team zero - team subzero, technically, because it's a zero indexed array - is Adam, Amy, and Chris. Good luck to you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Team sub one is Nick, Amal, and Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** Hello!

**Nick Nisi:** We're number one.

**Jerod Santo:** Before we commence round one, I thought maybe you would like to talk trash to each other for a minute or two?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That man bun looks so cool.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Of course, Adam's referring to Nick's gameboard avatar. If you are an audio-only listener, don't worry. You can listen right along. But this is one of those episodes where it's pretty good to have video, because we will have a game board live the entire game. So check it out at youtube.com/changelog and you can see Nick Nisi's man bun, which is... Cute. Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** Amazing. Thank you, Jerod.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like it, honestly. It's kind of -- it suits you, Nick. I'm imagining maybe you just ate a bite of hamburger, and it accidentally had mustard on it or something like that, and you're making a face, like in disgust. Is that what happened?

**Nick Nisi:** Pretty much, yeah. My daughter did my hair, so only positive things to say about it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay. Mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup... What's your thing on burgers, Nick?

**Jerod Santo:** This is the worst trash talk I've ever heard. "What's your thing on burgers?"

**Nick Nisi:** Um, nothing. I've never had ketchup, or mustard, or any other thing. I just have them plain...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What...?!

**Nick Nisi:** ...because I am a functioning six-year-old. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I was going to say... A boring human. Amy, will you please talk some trash at these people and say like "We're going to win" or "You guys stink", or something?

**Amy Dutton:** Well, the last time Adam and I were on a team together, we did win.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We did win. Yes. Last minute, in clutch, unrecorded. We won't say anymore.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:07:42.01\] That's true. Well, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. We have seven rounds of play. Each round we will have two people face off, and get a chance to guess first. Whoever gets the highest answer on the board gets to play that round. Their team then takes over, they get a guess until they have three strikes - that's three wrong guesses - at which point the other team can confer amongst themselves and steal that round's points by guessing one of the remaining answers that are on the board. Generally speaking, an answer only makes the board if it has five or more responses. There's a couple of rounds for which that's not true, but we'll address those as we get there. Any questions about how the game works before we dive into around one?

**Amal Hussein:** So what's the genre, like, of questions here? Like, is this like existential questions about like life, or -- like, what's the genre? Like, how can I mentally prepare for what's ahead of me?

**Jerod Santo:** I would say the genre is developer life.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay. Dev life.

**Nick Nisi:** But not friends, right? Because I'll fail. It's Friendly Feud.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Nick Nisi:** Before it was Frontend Feud.

**Jerod Santo:** It's just developer life. We are broader than frontend.

**Nick Nisi:** I know, but not into friends... I don't know what that is.

**Christopher Hiller:** Do you have to guess first? Or do you press a button, or something?

**Jerod Santo:** So because of internet latency, which we've already enjoyed some today, we do not do timed guessing. We do rotational guessing. So we will give each team a chance to guess first, but during the face-off, I will just name the person who guesses first. Makes sense?

**Amal Hussein:** And then how do we work as a team? Do we get to kind of confer, like with collaborate with each other? Or --

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Only during the steal moment.

**Amal Hussein:** Ah, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** At any other time, you just shut your trap and hope your teammate's awesome. \[laughter\] And no googling, no clauding, you cannot deepseek, you cannot shallowseek... We just sit, we enjoy, and we see who wins. Sound good?

**Amal Hussein:** This is like a strictly like hands-on-deck situation. Hands up in the air, fingers where you can see them, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. No typing...

**Amal Hussein:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How do we talk amongst each other? Like, just here in the chat here, the conversation?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, during the conferring you say it out loud, so that we can all hear it. You think out loud. And then during the guessing, you don't talk unless it's your turn. I feel like you guys are asking questions just to mess with me at this point...

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, no, that's a serious one, because if we start guessing or talking amongst each other, the other teams hears our insights.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, they're done at that point. Don't worry, I'll direct how it's going to work. They don't have a chance to do anything. They're done. They've had three strikes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I see. I understand. Okay, cool. The flow. It's a flow.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's move into round one... And our face-off for round one will be between Adam and Nick. Step right up. Now, you don't actually step anywhere, because we're just here in a virtual environment...

**Adam Stacoviak:** A virtual step.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Round one. We asked our listeners, "What's the first robot that comes to your mind?" What is the first robot that comes to your mind? The top six answers are on the board. And because he's a guest now, we will let Nick guess first. Nick, what do you think they said?

**Nick Nisi:** I'm going to go with R2-D2.

**Jerod Santo:** R2-D2. Is it on the board? \[win alert\] Yes, sir. And it is the number one answer, with 22 responses. Good job, Nick.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm so glad to know that I'm basic... Because I would have had the same guess. So this is great.

**Jerod Santo:** You just called our entire listening audience basic as well, so... Thank you for that.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Basic minds \[unintelligible 00:11:39.14\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, gotcha. Basic minds think alike. Yeah. So that means Nick's team -- because he hit number one, Adam doesn't even get a chance to guess. Adam can just sit there and be remorseful. And team sub one gets to play this round. So Nick went first. You got the first item on the board. R2-D2, 22 points. There are six total, which means there's five left. We go now to Amal. What's the first robot that comes to your mind? You cannot say R2-D2.

**Amal Hussein:** \[00:12:06.27\] Literally, I am predictable, and... Yeah, R2-D2 would have been my answer. The next thing that came to mind was Jibo, which I don't think anybody even remembers that thing existed. This is going to sound like a really silly answer, but Chatbot. Can I answer chatbot? ...even though that's not a specific bot, but it's a...

**Jerod Santo:** You certainly can. But did our listeners type into the text field "chatbot"? Let's see if it's on the board. \[fail alert\] Sorry, but that one is not a top six answer. That's one strike to your team. We go now to Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** I mean, I am terrible at this thing, but the thing that sprung to my mind was iRobot.

**Jerod Santo:** iRobot, the great...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, that was a movie title.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, based off a book, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well...

**Kevin Ball:** I don't even know what it is. It's just that's what came to my mind. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I won't say the robot's name then, because that is memorable.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, Kball goes with iRobot. Did it make the top six? \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but it also was not on the list. Nick, you have a lot to choose from. There's five answers left on the board, but your team has two strikes, which means if you get this wrong, it's time to steal. What do you think?

**Nick Nisi:** Well, I know what I want to answer, but I'm not going to do it... So I'm just going to stay with the theme. C-3PO.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us C-3PO. \[fail alert\] Oh, my goodness.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...!

**Jerod Santo:** A complete strikeout, with zero correct answers, except R2-D2. That means team zero, there are 22 points on the board, and you have lots of opportunity to get them, because there's five robots left that have not been said out loud. Now, you three can confer. So talk amongst yourselves. You'll get the 22 points plus whatever you score with this particular guess, if you get one. What do you think?

**Amy Dutton:** I have a couple in mind.

**Christopher Hiller:** We only have one guess?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Christopher Hiller:** Okay.

**Amy Dutton:** We're conferring, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes, we are conferring. Johnny No. 5, WALL-E, Rosie...

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, yeah. Let's go with WALL-E.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sunny from iRobot, thank you, Kball.

**Amy Dutton:** Hal9000...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hal9000...

**Amy Dutton:** Jarvis?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Jarvis, yes... Which one's on the board, though?

**Kevin Ball:** All of these sound vaguely familiar to me, but I would not have been able to generate any.

**Christopher Hiller:** Marvin, the Paranoid Android...

**Adam Stacoviak:** The audience is young, so Johnny 5 is not on the board, I think.

**Christopher Hiller:** Yeah. Let's go WALL-E.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking WALL-E. But no...

**Christopher Hiller:** I mean, it would seem to be like the most... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, final answer... What do y'all think? What are you going with?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What other famous robot is out there? What about like the Boston Dynamics ones? Do those have names.?

**Christopher Hiller:** Robot Dog? \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Those are pretty famous in the geek world. I'm thinking WALL-E though. I think WALL-E is probably --

**Amy Dutton:** Yeah, I'd go for WALL-E. WALL-E's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, WALL-E for the steal... Is it there? \[win alert\] Yes, it is. And it is the number two answer, with 20 respondents. That means team sub zero steals 42 points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We should be able to get some more points. I'm sure our other options were there.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, let's see what else was there. At number six we have Bender.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. \[unintelligible 00:15:36.13\]

**Jerod Santo:** Of course, from Futurama fame. Seven people said Bender. In slot five - there's Rosie.

**Amy Dutton:** Should have gotten that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Eight people picked Rosie from the Jetsons.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Roomba...

**Jerod Santo:** A Roomba...

**Amy Dutton:** We named our Roomba Rosie.

**Jerod Santo:** And \[unintelligible 00:15:51.02\] Marvin.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. Marvin's pretty good, yeah. Rosie's spelled incorrectly. I believe it's an ie, right? Isn't it ie?

**Amal Hussein:** Rosie is a really good one. Yeah, these are all like fantastic.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bender... I love Bender.

**Jerod Santo:** Bender's awesome.

**Nick Nisi:** They're like all of a different era.

**Amal Hussein:** Right. Which is I think the best part. They're so spread.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:16:14.27\] They are, aren't they? It's interesting.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, good job, sub zero.

**Jerod Santo:** Good job, everybody. So, a couple of honorable mentions... So, Kball, you guessed iRobot... Four people said iRobot, so you were very close. Three people said "the one from Lost in Space." The robot from Lost in Space. Mr. Robot got three...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Even though he's not really a robot, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I almost thought about that one. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** C3PO only had two, so he's nowhere near as beloved as R2-D2... The OpenAI web crawler got a shout out.

**Nick Nisi:** Was it actually just crawling the survey...?

**Jerod Santo:** And... Mark Zuckerberg.

**Christopher Hiller:** Mark Zuckerberg...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Mark Zuckerberg?

**Jerod Santo:** Mark Zuckerberg wasn't crawling the survey, but he also got a shout-out as a robot, so there you go.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** After round one, team sub zero is in the lead with 42 points, but there's lots of rounds left, so we move around to round two, Amy versus Amal. Alright, now, team sub one got to go first last round, so Amy gets to guess first. We asked our listeners "What is your favorite file format?" The top five answers are on the board. Amy, what do you think they said?

**Amy Dutton:** I'm going to stick with the front-end theme, and go .ts. Just for you, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** .ts? Is it on there? \[win alert\] If it was, I would have deleted it.

**Amy Dutton:** No...! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nobody likes .ts. Everybody knows that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's too obscure. Nobody likes that.

**Amy Dutton:** That would have fixed the number problem.

**Jerod Santo:** It's not a problem, it's a feature.

**Amal Hussein:** It's a feature... Oh, my gosh. Well, so this is so funny... I feel like I'm being trolled right now, because I'm literally in the middle of a design decision on some new config files, and we're arguing over YAML versus TOML, because obviously, nobody wants JSON, because you can't do comments... JSON is for computers, not humans... So it's between -- so, I mean, YAML is great until it's not. Like most things, love-hate relationship. I almost want to say -- I want to say TOML, but I'm not sure how popular it is, really. Oh, my God... I also just want to say .txt, because, like "Ha, ha, ha." I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Pick one. What do you want?

**Amal Hussein:** Let's go with YAML. I feel like YAML has got to be on the board. Or you know what? Can I -- I'm sorry. Let me go with TOML.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's too late. It's too late.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, fine. Fine. Fine.

**Jerod Santo:** Is it on there? We all know it's not on there. \[fail alert\] No. Nobody likes YAML.

**Amal Hussein:** No, I figured, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** This is their favorite file format. It's not like it's okay... Alright, back to you, Amy. We haven't landed yet, so here you get a second chance.

**Amy Dutton:** It's like, I know what my favorite file format is... Let's mix it up.

**Jerod Santo:** You already said it.

**Amy Dutton:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** .ts?

**Amy Dutton:** \[laughs\] I'm just going to go with .svg. Let's go for the images. That's not my answer, though. I am going to go with an image, though. Let's try a .png. A png.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us png. \[fail alert\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Amy Dutton:** Who takes this survey...?

**Jerod Santo:** Um, our lovely audience takes it, thank you very much...

**Amy Dutton:** Not me...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I asked you guys not to take it. Okay, Amal, back to you. I mean, someone's got to get one eventually.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, now I'm going to say the wrong answer in hopes that it's on the board, which is JSON.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so she thinks maybe JSON... Even though you don't think it's your favorite, maybe somebody does. Does anybody think it's their favorite? \[win alert\] Yes, they certainly do. And it is the number two answer, with 27 people love JSON.

**Amal Hussein:** \[00:20:12.19\] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, nothing wrong with JSON, it's just not great for humans communicating, which is what for me would put it into a favorite. If it's just machines communicating, then... Yeah, all good.

**Jerod Santo:** If it's just machines, you might as well be using a binary format, right, Kball? Kball, you're up now. You guys take the round.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm going to go with the ye olde txt file.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us plain text... \[win alert\] Yes, sir. And man, there it is, plain text. 24 people love it. They love it. They love it.

Nick, what do you love?

**Nick Nisi:** I love plain text, and I love the improvement of plain text that is Markdown.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Markdown. \[win alert\] Number one answer. Of course, everyone's favorite file format. 35 people said Markdown, and they're my friends. Nick gets it right. So far, you have 86 points amongst yourselves, and zero strikes. Amal, back to you. There's two left on the board. Slots four and five.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, this is awesome, because I completely spaced out about Markdown, because I'm thinking about what's used at runtime... Let's see. I wonder if MDX is on the board.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to lock that in?

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, yeah. Sorry... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** It was more of a question than a statement... Show us MDX. Not DMX, everyone's favorite rapper... \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but it's not on there. First strike. Back to Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright. Well, let's see. So we've got Markdown, we've got JSON, we've got plain text...

**Amy Dutton:** These are also AI's favorite formats.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Who took this survey...?

**Kevin Ball:** I'm actually going to go -- I'm going to go a little older school and I'm going to say XML.

**Amal Hussein:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us XML. \[fail alert\] Strike two. Back to Nick. Nick, it's all on your shoulders here.

**Amal Hussein:** You've got to save us, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Again...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No commenting.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, favorite file format... Ah, we're on a podcast, I'm going to say MP3.

**Jerod Santo:** MP3. Is it on there? \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, it is not. Strike three means we're back where we were last round. Team sub zero, opportunity to steal. Please confer amongst yourselves. You have the slots four and five. If you hit either one of those, you get all these points, and then some.

**Christopher Hiller:** People like GIFs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's where I was going, b0neskull. GIFs.

**Amy Dutton:** Yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's got to be the one -- I mean, that's the one on there, right? We're talking about nerds here. Like, nerds. Come on.

**Amy Dutton:** You've got to get your memes.

**Christopher Hiller:** Maybe like Zip...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Zip could be there, but maybe...

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm thinking GIF.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Amy, do you agree with that?

**Amy Dutton:** I do agree. Wholeheartedly.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. For the steal, 86 points on the board... Is it GIF? \[fail alert\] No, it's not. Which means those 86 points are awarded to team sub-one.

**Amal Hussein:** Yay. Good job. Good job.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** And they take the lead. Now, let's see what was in slots four and five. In the number five slot, we have everyone's favorite file-based database, SQLite.

**Nick Nisi:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Six people love SQLite files.

**Nick Nisi:** That makes sense... In all the world, six people.

**Jerod Santo:** There's lots to like. There's lots to like.

**Amal Hussein:** There is. I mean, SQL brings this calm to my nervous system that nothing else really brings that level of calm when it comes to programming.

**Jerod Santo:** Right? And there's some people that have found that in certain circumstances it's actually faster than the file system.

**Nick Nisi:** The Mongo people are just rolling in the grave right now...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:24:12.29\] Oh, gosh... And at number four, the other file format that people love is CSV. Eight people said CSV.

**Kevin Ball:** That's a choice...

**Nick Nisi:** The survey got into a bank, or something...

**Amal Hussein:** No, it does make sense though. CSVs are awesome, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Here's some honorable mentions. So TOML got four shout-outs, which beat YAML, which got two... TAR... No one said TAR. Three people like tarballs. Amy, SVG got three shout-outs... Only two people said GIF, and nobody said JIF, because that's not how you say it. And then finally, one person said "the one with code in it." That's their favorite file format, is the one with code in it.

Okay. After two rounds, team sub one is in the lead, almost doubling - no, more than doubling team sub zero's points. 86 for Team 1 and 42 for Team 0.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Seven rounds, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Seven rounds. We move now to round three. Of course, we asked "What is your favorite file format?", but we also would love to know, "What is your least favorite file format?" This round starts off with a face-off between Kball and Chris. Step right up. Kball, you get to go first this round. What do you think is our listeners' least favorite --

**Kevin Ball:** I'm going to bring it back. We're going to throw XML out there again.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my God... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You guessed XML for favorite... Now you might think it's the least favorite. Is it on the board? Least favorite? Let's see it. \[fail alert\] Yes, sirree, Bob. And it is the least favorite of all people. 28 respondents despise XML. So we find ourselves in familiar territory, Team 1 is playing this round as well. Nick, we go to you. There are seven on the board. XML is number one, which means two through seven are still out there.

**Nick Nisi:** Hm... I am going to say YAML. I think that everybody hates YAML. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is like the backfire round. Or I guess last round backfired. This round is more accurate, because yes... \[win alert\] YAML, the number two response, with 25 people despising it. Amal, to you.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, that was going to be my answer, was YAML. It's functional, but no one likes to tab. Let's see. I'm really tempted to say JSON, because I think the lack of trailing commas and comments is really quite frustrating for many folks... But I don't know. It's between -- well, I don't want to put multiple answers out there, but... And I cannot confer with my team, right? I can't get advice.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can attempt, but you can't.

**Amal Hussein:** But I can't. You know what? Let's put JSON on the board. Why not?

**Jerod Santo:** Why not? Show us JSON. \[win alert\] Number seven. Five people said JSON. So you now have one, two, and seven. And those middle ones need guessing. Kball?

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, I'm going to go .doc.

**Amal Hussein:** I was just thinking that.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Word docs. \[win alert\] Yes, at number four. 19 people said they hate Word docs. To Nick - you're halfway home. Actually, you're more than halfway home. You've got four of seven; numbers three, five, and six still available.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, we have YAML, we have docs, we have JSON, XML... I know TypeScript won't be on there, so... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:28:09.18\] Because people aren't thinking about it. That's a \[unintelligible 00:28:11.12\]

**Nick Nisi:** Because they're being productive.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, my God... I've like really -- I've like missed Nick being trolled by Jerod so much.

**Nick Nisi:** And the other way around, right?

**Amal Hussein:** And the other way around, yeah. The circle. They're like a Tom and Jerry situation, you know? I think the real question is who's Tom and who's Jerry, you know?

**Nick Nisi:** No, it's like a roadrunner \[unintelligible 00:28:31.25\]

**Jerod Santo:** We all know which one I am. Mee-mee!

**Nick Nisi:** The coyote.

**Jerod Santo:** See how slow you were on that? \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:28:43.17\] dropped on your head just now.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, totally. Alright, Nick, what have you got?

**Nick Nisi:** If I go with my previous, thinking that bankers took this survey, then -- I'm going to say the text files.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us text files. \[fail alert\] First strike.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes...!

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Amal...

**Adam Stacoviak:** The demise begins...

**Amal Hussein:** I think I'm going to say Excel/spreadsheet/CSV. Basically, they're all like proprietary or non-proprietary versions of the same thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, pick one.

**Amal Hussein:** Well, I mean, do I have to?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you said slash spreadsheet. I mean, is that a file format, slash spreadsheet?

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, open spreadsheet is a thing. Alright, so I think -- let's do... Yeah, CSV.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, CSV was in the list of favorite file formats. Are you sure?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh my God, stop making me doubt myself. Hold on... I'm not sure.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win alert\] It's on there.

**Amal Hussein:** It's on there? Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I was messing with you. I was trolling you. It's been too long...

**Amal Hussein:** I was like "Oh, no...!"

**Jerod Santo:** Number six.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, yay. Yeah, Excel. \[unintelligible 00:30:03.05\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot. Did you say CSV?

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, I was just there -- like, okay, Excel, CSV, spreadsheet... Same family, same category.

**Jerod Santo:** CSV is also correct...

**Amal Hussein:** Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, she said all three. She said this, that...

**Amal Hussein:** I really did, in all fairness.

**Jerod Santo:** I forgot which one she actually picked.

**Amal Hussein:** It's the same number of points either way.

**Jerod Santo:** It doesn't matter. They have to get this one. They have to get this one.

**Kevin Ball:** I feel like this game is a little biased, right? Like, to steal you only have to get one right. But if -- we've got to run the table.

**Amal Hussein:** Exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's how the game works.

**Jerod Santo:** Take it in with Steve Harvey. I didn't design this game. Alright, Kball...

**Kevin Ball:** We've got -- already on the board we have XML, YAML, Word, CSV, Excel, and JSON. And the question is, "What's missing that's a least favorite?"

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm kind of -- I'm pondering PDF. I feel like that might be up there. Yeah, I'm going to go with that. I'm going to say PDF.

**Nick Nisi:** Like PDF more than YAML, but less than Word?

**Kevin Ball:** I feel like -- I actually suspect this has a lot to do with like how much people are exposed to it, and also how much annoying it is to modify... And dealing with PDFs -- like, the tooling has gotten better, but I bet that's still up there. So I'm going to I'm going to put PDF out there.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Is PDF that missing number three of the seven least favorite file formats? \[win alert\] He got it...!

**Kevin Ball:** Nice...

**Jerod Santo:** With 20 respondents not liking PDF. I think that's exactly right, Kball. We know about it, and we've tried to program with it, and it sucks to work with.

**Amal Hussein:** I also love it when websites just stick PDFs on the website, and it's like, you can't select text, there's no indexing or searching of the content... It's rough, rough times.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:31:57.28\] We were just talking a couple of weeks ago with Bert Hubert - I can't say his name appropriately - who makes a government tracking website in the Netherlands, and he was just doing the opposite of singing PDF's phrases. He was just saying how bad PDF is to work with. And a lot of governments, even with FOIA and whatever kind of stuff where the documents are supposed to be public, they just throw PDFs out because they know it's harder to work with. And it's like, at that point, I would love XML, even though I hate it, compared to PDF. So I'm actually surprised, but... XML is top of mind, I think, when you think of things you don't like.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. What we really need for like non-programmers is like Webflow... Something that can make something pretty and easy, but you get all the benefits of it being structured HTML. What it spits out, you know... But yeah.

**Nick Nisi:** Dreamweaver.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, I think you're right.

**Jerod Santo:** I was gonna say, was that a product placement, Amal? That was really good. You're like "What we really need is Webflow." \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Not paid or sponsored by Webflow.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, so I think we're getting away from the topic, which is we are dominating, so we need to get back on the topic of our domination, and give Team Zero a chance to show their zeros...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, now K-Ball's getting alive...

**Kevin Ball:** I mean, I was waiting for y'all to pick up the trash talk, and nobody was filling it in.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The only reason you guys won that round is because Jerod gave you the bonus, okay? You'd have faltered on the bonus. CSV and Excel are not the same. She got two for one.

**Jerod Santo:** They had strikes to spare. They had strikes to spare. Okay, we're gonna award -- this is 109 points now going over there to Team One. And after round three, it's starting to look like a wipeout. Team One has 195 and Team Zero has 42. There's lots of rounds left. We move now to round four.

**Break**: \[00:34:04.09\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is the inverted round. The inverted round works differently. There's no face-off. We just toggle back and forth between teams, with an opportunity to guess. The question that we asked our listener is "Name the first protocol that comes to your mind." However, in the inverted round you get more points for matching further down the board. So the number one answer is worth the least amount of points, and the number five answer is worth the most amount of points. Since he's been sitting quietly most of the game, we will let Adam go first.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Fantastic.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** What?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Fantastic.

**Amal Hussein:** The look on Adam's face is just priceless. It's just priceless.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well...

**Jerod Santo:** What do you think, Adam? The first protocol that comes to your mind, but actually the fifth first... You know what I'm saying?

**Adam Stacoviak:** The fifth first? Oh, gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, if you want more points, you've got to get down the board. If you want not as many points, you name the actual first protocol.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What the heck is a protocol, in particular?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, there's no follow-up questions on the survey, so it's however they interpret it.

**Amal Hussein:** That's like a good name for a memoir. "What the hell is a protocol?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I didn't say hell...

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, you didn't say hell, sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** She's spicing up your biography.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And it's the "Name, the first protocol that comes to your mind."

**Jerod Santo:** The text that you're reading right there on the game board is literally the text that they read in the survey.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The first one that comes to mind, and it's the fifth answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you would love to get the fifth...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh.

**Jerod Santo:** ...but you could get the fourth, or the third...

**Adam Stacoviak:** So I'm just trying to get one. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you just want to match the board, but the lower down, you get more points. And you guys are quite a ways behind...

**Amy Dutton:** Thanks for reminding.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm not really sure what a protocol is in particular. I mean, is it like an API? Or is it --

**Amal Hussein:** Can I explain it? Am I allowed to explain it, Jerod?

**Nick Nisi:** Don't help him, don't help him.

**Jerod Santo:** No, go ahead, Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** No, I mean, it's basically... So the term comes from the --

**Nick Nisi:** \[whispering\] He's not on our team...

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, fine. Then I will not. According to --

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, gosh...

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, Nick is whispering "He's not on our team..." He's on our bigger team... You know?

**Jerod Santo:** How about this, Adam - I will give you a for instance...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sure. Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and one that isn't actually up there, so we'll all know that it's not up there. But here's a, for instance. gRPC is a protocol that one person said. But it's not up there. It's not in the top five. So you're trying to find another protocol similar to that...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Like WebSockets. Let's put WebSockets out there then.

**Jerod Santo:** WebSockets. Alright. Show us WebSockets. \[fail alert\] That one also did not make the top five. We go now to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** What, you're trying to throw us off with this gRPC? So I'm going to go tRPC.

**Jerod Santo:** What's that?

**Nick Nisi:** TypeScript RPC.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my gosh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh... No one's going to guess that.

**Jerod Santo:** Let me just not even make it dramatic. \[fail alert\] Ridiculous.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm pretty sure that's also not a real protocol.

**Jerod Santo:** Not only was the answer wrong, it was kind of silly.

**Nick Nisi:** It is.

**Amal Hussein:** Really? By who? By what? What standards body?

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. We go to Amy.

**Amy Dutton:** Oh, I get to go. This is probably higher up on the board, but I'm going to go with HTTPS.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Show us HTTPS. \[win alert\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** It's on there. Number three. 16 people said HTTPS, which gives 15 points. We'll award those immediately, and go back over to team one, to Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, man... Now that I know HTTP is lower, I'm like "Oh, man... Oh, no." I thought it was going to be number one. Let's say UDP.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us UDP. \[fail alert\] Not on the board. Chris.

**Christopher Hiller:** SSH.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us SSH. \[win alert\] It's on there, and it's the lowest answer, which is the most points.

**Amy Dutton:** Nice...!

**Adam Stacoviak:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** You scored 25 points.

**Amal Hussein:** I would have totally expected that to be number one, if not HTTP... But wow.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, team zero coming back now... We go to team one and Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** Did we already say TCP?

**Jerod Santo:** We did not. We said UDP.

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, I think TCP.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us TCP. \[win alert\] It's on there, second most popular answer. 20 people said it. That gives you 10 points.

**Amal Hussein:** I thought UDP was going to score like lower than TCP... I was trying to go low... Didn't work.

**Jerod Santo:** Back to team zero and back to Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Maybe just DNS.

**Jerod Santo:** Another good guess. Show us DNS. \[fail alert\] Not on the top five. Back to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Is your survey automatically redirecting to HTTPS for all non-secure traffic?

**Jerod Santo:** Is that a weird way of asking if it's also a different thing? \[laughter\] I did not combine any protocols into a singular protocol.

**Nick Nisi:** \[00:42:15.13\] Okay. HTTP.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, there's our number one, HTTP. \[win alert\] With an overwhelming 90 people saying HTTP, only worth five points. But hey, it's still five points. We go back to team zero and Amy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on, Amy.

**Jerod Santo:** Can you find the last one? We've got HTTP at the top, TCP, then HTTPS, then a blank splot... What's a splot? A blank spot. And then in fifth, SSH.

**Amy Dutton:** I'm going to go with FTP.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, good job.

**Jerod Santo:** All your favorite files. Do you transfer them? Let's see... \[win alert\] Yessiree.

**Amal Hussein:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** FTP, yessiree. Six people said FTP, which is worth 20 points. We'll award those now. Alright. Very good. Thus ends the inverted round. I think team zero scored more there than team one, because they've closed the gap. However, team one still has more than twice as many points, with 210.

**Adam Stacoviak:** For now.

**Jerod Santo:** Team zero with 102. We have three rounds left, so there's lots of game to play... And we move now to round five.

This one's a little bit different. We asked our listeners to choose a number between 1 and 20. But we said "Your goal is to choose the number that you think the fewest other people are going to choose."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay? Now, your job is to guess the one that they chose the most, that they think people chose the least.

**Amal Hussein:** Can I just state for a fact that -- I mean, I don't want to speak too soon, but it feels really great to be on the winning team...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my gosh...

**Amal Hussein:** I just wanna put that out there... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** And you just lost.

**Nick Nisi:** They not like us... They not like us...

**Jerod Santo:** That's when the Arrested Development narrator comes in and is like "She wasn't", you know...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, thanks... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We're going to start with Nick. Nick, which number, including and between 1 and 20 - so it's less than or equal to - do you think our listeners chose the most, that would be chosen the least?

**Nick Nisi:** First, we need to break down this form. Did you code it?

**Jerod Santo:** Did I code this form?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, that people were filling out.

**Jerod Santo:** It's just a PHP file that posts to itself.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, PHP... PHP distinguishes between ints and non-ints, right?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, my God...

**Nick Nisi:** It's got floats, and stuff... I'm wondering if it has to be an integer.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm wondering if you can just guess something. \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** The least chosen in a form like this, and knowing our audience of bankers, I'm going to say 3.14159.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm thoroughly confused as to what we're doing in this round... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, show me 3.14159. \[fail alert\] No, that's a foolish answer. Okay. To you, Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The correct number is one of two numbers... Which one should I choose?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughter\] I like this...

**Nick Nisi:** "Is it one or two?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's between one of two numbers that I'm going to say.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I will declare them soon. I will only declare one, to not give away the other hand...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm going to go with number nine.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us nine. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but that was not one of the top six answers. Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, back to me. Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Against my better judgment.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm going to say 19.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:46:00.05\] Show us 19. \[win alert\] There it is, 19. So 12 people chose 19 thinking that that number would be chosen the least. So team one gets to play another round. Amal, if our audience had to choose a number between 1 and 20, with a goal of choosing the number that they think the fewest other people will choose, which ones would be chosen the most?

**Amal Hussein:** Any other layers to this game? Any other inverted --

**Jerod Santo:** Not yet.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Just straight up.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm going to choose my favorite number, which is seven.

**Jerod Santo:** So you think your favorite number is the least chosen number?

**Amal Hussein:** I'm just a gambling woman.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you're just going straight gambler. Alright. She's a gambler. Is it on there? \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, it's not. K-ball.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm going to go with one of the ends, so I'm going to go with 20. \[fail alert\]

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 20.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** Back to you, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** That was my strategy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You should probably say one then, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** You're right. I'm going to say two.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's exactly what I \[unintelligible 00:47:06.09\] to do.

**Jerod Santo:** Completely out of left field... Is two? \[fail alert\] No, siree...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Two is an amazing number.

**Jerod Santo:** Three strikes and you guys are out. You only guessed one of the top six numbers that people chose, thinking that nobody would choose them... Which means it's time to steal, and you can confirm amongst yourselves. There are five possible matches up there, and we've eliminated quite a few numbers. So, I mean, at a certain point, it gets to be good odds.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Nick Nisi:** It's not pi...

**Amy Dutton:** 13.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's arbitrary, is what it is. I was thinking 17, but I like 18 as well.

**Christopher Hiller:** I was thinking 17.

**Amy Dutton:** Yeah, prime. 11.

**Christopher Hiller:** Prime numbers.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we got 17 or 11...

**Amy Dutton:** The other question is how OCD is our audience?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Very.

**Jerod Santo:** Why do you ask that?

**Amy Dutton:** Well, my husband fits into this category when he's doing the volume; the volume cannot be on certain numbers. So I would also say this is kind of like that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, potentially. That's why I'm thinking 17. High enough, but odd.

**Jerod Santo:** Final answer?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know. 11 is also a pretty good number. What do you think, Chris?

**Christopher Hiller:** I like 17.

**Adam Stacoviak:** 17. What do you think, Amy? You thinking 17?

**Amy Dutton:** Lock it in. Lock it in.

**Jerod Santo:** For the steal, was 17 the number that was the most chosen by people thinking it would be the least chosen? \[win alert\] Yes, it was. Number one answer, 17!

**Amy Dutton:** Nice!

**Amal Hussein:** That's impressive. Good job, guys.

**Jerod Santo:** 34 people chose 17 thinking that the least number of people would choose 17.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, when I said I had two numbers, it was 9 and 17.

**Jerod Santo:** You guys steal and you get 46 points, because there was a lot left on the board. I will award those now and we'll see what else was on there. So number six - Nick should have said one, because 10 people did go for one.

**Amal Hussein:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** In fifth --

**Amy Dutton:** Adam told you...

**Jerod Santo:** ...the number eight. 11 people thought eight would be chosen the least. The number 13 - 12 people. And is 11 on there? No, it's not. You would not have stolen. 14 was picked 12 times.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, give us all those points.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, here's the actually least chosen... I already gave you the points. You don't get these.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I want those points...

**Jerod Santo:** Here's the actually least chosen ones. 19.9 was once. 3.1415 was only chosen once, Nick. You were very close.

**Nick Nisi:** Dang it.

**Jerod Santo:** 6.9, and then somebody chose 8.12387651230988, and then a whole bunch of zeros. So I should have said integer.

**Kevin Ball:** Clearly.

**Jerod Santo:** Somebody spelled out the word four, but that didn't fool me. I can normalize that. One person said E, or Euler's number, which we all know is the base of the natural logarithm and exponential function that approximates at 2.71828.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We all know that. Yeah, I agree.

**Nick Nisi:** \[00:50:05.12\] Yeah, it's the powerhouse of the cell. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Is that mitochondria.

**Amal Hussein:** Mitochondria? Jinx. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And then the actual number that was chosen the least is five. Only one person chose five. So you win, whoever chose five. You win. Well played.

**Amal Hussein:** That was very well played.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so after now five rounds, it's getting pretty close, actually. Team zero has 148, and team one has 210. We move now to round six. Okay, this is a bit inverted, because we also asked them "What number do you think will be chosen the most in the previous question, aka the worst choice?" So they had to guess which would be chosen the least, and then they had to guess which one would be chosen the most.

Now, you know what was chosen the most, that they thought would be chosen the least. But now you have to guess what was chosen... \[unintelligible 00:51:01.17\]

**Amal Hussein:** I was gonna say, can you even say that with a straight face, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm enjoying this a lot... It's very hard to keep a straight face. Facing off in this round is Amy and Amal, and we'll start with Amy. So which of those less than one, less than 20 numbers will be chosen the most? Not were chosen the most, but that the person thought would be chosen the most right after they selected the one they thought would be chosen the least?

**Amy Dutton:** Ten.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us ten. \[fail alert\] Sorry. Didn't register. Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** I honestly don't -- unfortunately my audio is a little lagged today as well, so between that and like this inception of confusion, I'm going to just guess a random number. Let's go with seven again.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us seven. \[win alert\] You randomly guessed the number one answer. 34 people thought seven will be chosen the most. But we all know that it wasn't, because 17 was chosen the most. Okay. So team one's playing again. We go to K-Ball.

**Kevin Ball:** I mean, under the principle of trying to invert, let's go with five.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us five. \[fail alert\] X marks that spot. Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** 14.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 14. \[fail alert\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nope. One more strike, Amal. Unfortunately, you guys are leaving the board so open that when they steal it, there's not much points left there.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah... Let's see. Is it my turn?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, just making sure. I'm lagged, I'm lagged. Let's do five.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us five. \[fail alert\] Third strike. A chance to steal once again. This has just been a game on repeat... Every round feels the same. Team one plays, team zero steals. What do you think?

**Adam Stacoviak:** The number one is an obvious choice...

**Christopher Hiller:** 8, 12, 16...

**Jerod Santo:** Even numbers? \[unintelligible 00:53:06.28\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I love that. \[laughter\] Well, we've got an odd number at the top there so far. And the premise, Jerod, is what exactly? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I can't remember... No, the premise is which of the numbers between 1 and 20 inclusive do you think most people are going to write down as one that will be chosen the least?

**Adam Stacoviak:** So clear. It's so clear.

**Christopher Hiller:** Do any of us feel strongly about the answer?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I feel like one was at the bottom last time. 17 was at the top. 17 is probably not on this board. And if it is, it's possible, maybe... But one's for sure going to be here. That's just my logic. But I'd love to be wrong.

**Christopher Hiller:** What do you think, Amy?

**Amy Dutton:** \[00:54:03.04\] Your guess is as good as mine.

**Christopher Hiller:** Okay, I think we're both -- yeah, just go ahead.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Do you feel strongly about -- what'd you say? 12, 17, 45, and what?

**Amy Dutton:** 45? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** What are we going with?

**Christopher Hiller:** Just one, I guess, right?

**Jerod Santo:** One.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, dial it in.

**Jerod Santo:** For the steal, did the most people think one would be the one that the most people chose would be the least chosen? \[win alert\] You stole it. The number two answer is one. 24 people thought one would be the one... Which means you steal a total of 58 points. It's getting tight, y'all.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Give those points up to us.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh my goodness, look at that score going into the final round. Team zero, 206. Team one, 210. And the last round is double points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is a repeat of THAT Conference.

**Amy Dutton:** I know, I wasn't going to jinx it.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you sweating?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. I'm smiling.

**Jerod Santo:** You're smiling, okay.

**Amy Dutton:** I'm sweating and smiling.

**Jerod Santo:** We could review the other ones that were chosen, but who cares? Let's move to round seven.

**Break**: \[00:55:20.12\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, it's time for another face-off. This goes Chris and Kball. We asked our audience, "What's the first programming-related movie that comes to your mind?" Sorry, Kball, I know you don't watch movies. I did not plan this. Chris can go first. Yes, Chris, a programming-related movie. There are five on the board, top five answers. What do you think?

**Christopher Hiller:** Hackers.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Hackers. \[win alert\] Number one answer, Hackers. 53 people said Hackers. That's double points, to 106, and for the first time, I believe, team zero is playing. Ooh, this is looking bad for you, Amal. Okay, we go to Adam. There are five on the board. We have number one, so two through four is still out there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is number two. Who's ready for number two?

**Jerod Santo:** We're ready.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Swordfish.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us. \[fail alert\] Swordfish is not number two.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What?! You've gotta be kidding me.

**Nick Nisi:** I've seen that. I've seen that movie.

**Amy Dutton:** You're gonna jinx us...

**Jerod Santo:** Uh-oh... This could be the all time choke job. \[laughter\] No pressure... I'm enjoying the heck out of this. Okay, Amy.

**Amy Dutton:** The Social Network.

**Jerod Santo:** The Social Network. Survey says... \[win alert\] Number four answer, the Social Network, with 14 responses, worth 28 points. Good guess, Amy.

**Nick Nisi:** That's not about programming...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, I didn't quite think that movie was ever about programming. It was more like "Here's the lesson in vengeful deceit", or like...

**Jerod Santo:** Programming-related, though...

**Kevin Ball:** And this is not about programming how?

**Amal Hussein:** And why you should trust nobody... Muhaha, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds like me with my code...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, that's funny. That's hilarious. Good job though, Amy.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Chris, back to you.

**Christopher Hiller:** Jurassic Park.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, my God.

**Nick Nisi:** That's a good one.

**Amy Dutton:** It's Unix. I know it.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a really good one. \[fail alert\] Unfortunately, it's not quite good enough. I loved that moment.

**Amy Dutton:** Adam, it's all you.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, but it's not top of mind. There are three left. We have number one, Hackers, two and three are blank, number four, the Social Network, and number five is also blank. So here I thought we'd just pick them off one by one, but there's a lot of movies that have subtle references that aren't necessarily top of mind. He's less confident this time around... Swordfish... \[unintelligible 01:00:04.04\] confidence...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, a little bit. I'm feeling down. Thinking, of course...

**Jerod Santo:** Can you be like one of those reasoning models that does its thinking out loud?

**Adam Stacoviak:** If I reasoned out loud, I would potentially help the team who may try to take me down.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, don't leak anything.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I'm not leaking, man.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm just trying to prompt-inject you. A few minutes later...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, it's against my better judgment... I'm thinking the audience connects Ready Player One to programming somehow.

**Nick Nisi:** They are bankers... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** But I could be wrong.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it's time to tell. Is he right or wrong? Is Ready Player One one of the top five programming-related movies that comes to our listeners' minds? \[fail alert\] It is not. He is wrong, and for the first time, team one gets to steal. And if they steal this, they steal the entire game, and Amal is totally justified. So you guys can confer. There's three options out there, you've just got to hit one of them.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, guys, guys, the Matrix, the Matrix, the Matrix, the Matrix, the Matrix.

**Kevin Ball:** I was thinking the Matrix the whole way.

**Amal Hussein:** The whole time. I was like -- I didn't even think about hackers or The Social Network. I was like "Matrix, Matrix." Okay, should we do it? So there's the Matrix, then there's the Reloaded and Revolutions. I think we should just say the Matrix. I'm sure it's on the board.

**Nick Nisi:** Yup. \[unintelligible 01:01:31.09\]

**Amy Dutton:** If you say all three, Jerod will give you all three.

**Jerod Santo:** Haah!

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, the Matrix, the Matrix, Revolutions, and the Matrix, Reloaded, I think.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so as of right now, team zero has 206 points, and team one has 210 points. Team zero won the round, they have 134 points scored already, they're banked. However, if the Matrix is in the top five, team one will steal a round and steal a game and be winners, and Amal will not look like a fool for having declared her victory prematurely. What is going to happen? Is the Matrix on the board? \[win alert\] It is!

**Amal Hussein:** \[01:02:10.15\] Oh, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Number two.

**Amal Hussein:** Nice, nice. Awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** The steal is successful. So 182 points go back to team one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Holy crap, that's a domination there...

**Amal Hussein:** I know, we've dominated...

**Jerod Santo:** It looks like a domination, even though it was very tight.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh yeah, yeah, that's true. It really was. It's all this stealing, you know?

**Kevin Ball:** I prefer to be in the stealing side, because I think the advantage is to you.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you guys want to see the other movies on the board?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm going to guess the Imitation Game.

**Jerod Santo:** Nope.

**Amal Hussein:** I was thinking V for Vendetta, and then I realized that that was actually -- that was just how the Anonymous logo was born, versus like... That's actually not about programming at all.

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Nick Nisi:** Tron? War Games?

**Amy Dutton:** I'm going to guess Her.

**Nick Nisi:** ...Sneakers, Her...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, well, I heard them all. I heard them all. So Sneakers was number five, with five people. You also said War Games, Nick.

**Christopher Hiller:** Wow...!

**Amal Hussein:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Honorable mentions - Tron... These all made less than five people. Tron, The Net, Swordfish got three, Adam... Very close. Her, Ex Machina, The Imitation Game, Gattaca, Pirates of the Silicon Valley... And of course, Silicon Valley, the TV show, which I can only assume was Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I didn't take the survey.

**Amal Hussein:** Adam, I sure hope you didn't take the survey...

**Adam Stacoviak:** And it was TV, it wasn't a movie. I would have guessed that if I'd have thought it was TV.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. There was a lot of TV shows on there. I'm like "Do y'all read the actual thing?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I was sticking to -- I guess they don't follow the rules, so we could have actually not followed the rules, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, for our very first game of Friendly Feud, with 392 points, Nick, Amal, and K-Ball, y'all win. Congratulations. \[applause\] Here's your fake applause.

**Amal Hussein:** I feel so -- like, this is the best welcome back hug ever, is to win... Although I did call people basic, but I didn't mean it in a bad way.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You did call them basic...

**Amy Dutton:** I thought you meant Basic programming.

**Nick Nisi:** I called them bankers. I think that's worse.

**Amal Hussein:** I just meant like I have a... Universal brain, that's like, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** You're supposed to say great minds think alike, but you said "All these people are basic." \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, my God... That's not what I meant. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, everybody, thanks for playing. Normally, we'll give our winning team a chance to like say a speech, or shout something out... Do you guys have anything to say, or are you all tuckered out?

**Kevin Ball:** I mean, I'm going to continue to channel my 11-year-old and like the Gen Z or alpha or whatever slang, which is -- he did this at some point when we just got destroyed in a video game... He says "Y'all got cooked, and I'm the chef. Noodles...!"

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Dang.

**Christopher Hiller:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** That's harsh.

**Kevin Ball:** We now will just go around in the house and something's going on and we'll just be like "Noodles...!" \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Chris, will you be doing noodles and then slurping in with your kids?

**Christopher Hiller:** I might try that, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, cool.

**Christopher Hiller:** That might go over pretty well.

**Kevin Ball:** I mean, y'all have heard the generational evolution of things, right? So back when we were young, things were "the s\*\*t." Then at some point it was like "Oh, that's fire." And then it was like "I'm going to cook you." And then it's like "You got eaten. I'm going to eat you." And pretty soon it's going to be back to where we were at the beginning, and it's coming out again.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, I didn't even think about that. Oh, my God...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You're not "THE s\*\*t", you're "MY s\*\*t".

**Jerod Santo:** Right...

**Kevin Ball:** There you go. There you go. That moves it around. But it's like, that's hot, that's fire... Oh, that's cooking. Oh, they were eaten. And it is evolving back towards where it was when we were all young.

**Christopher Hiller:** And they did "sick", too.

**Jerod Santo:** Sick, yeah.

**Nick Nisi:** Does Ohio mean good or is that bad?

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:06:14.10\] Does Ohio mean good?

**Kevin Ball:** Only when compared to Nebraska.

**Jerod Santo:** Ah... Nick, why do you set people up to get burned, to get cooked?

**Nick Nisi:** That's the thing, they say that's Ohio... Right? I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** ...to get noodles.

**Kevin Ball:** Have you all played this game, though? Those of you with kids who are in that preteen or teen thing, where you get a list of the sayings that they do, and you get them to sit there with water in their mouths and you just deadpan the sayings, and see how long they can last without busting up and splurting all the water out?

**Amal Hussein:** I think that's the new... What do you call that? That's the hot wings chicken show, or whatever. What am I thinking about?

**Nick Nisi:** Hot Ones.

**Amal Hussein:** Hot ones, yes. It's like a variation of that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like the one with the tortillas and the water in their mouth. Y'all seen that one?

**Kevin Ball:** Tortilla slap challenge? Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah. They slap each other.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's hilarious.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, there was one going around where somebody -- they were doing that and the guy just slapped himself, and the other guy busted up.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. I don't know, my sister's six and a half years younger than me, and we're both in the same decade now, but every time I hang out with her, I feel like I come back with such a, like, 50 new vocabulary words and terms... It's amazing how old and out of touch I am.

**Jerod Santo:** Can you share one for us?

**Amal Hussein:** I don't know anything... I mean, this one isn't even new I'll share, but I used it recently in a sentence, and then someone else at work started to use it. She was like "Oh, this thing is so clutch", you know? She's like "Oh my God, yeah, that's so clutch." And I'm like "Oh, you're using clutch in a different way than I've used it", you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Was she showing you her small hand purse?

**Amal Hussein:** No, no, it was not a clutch in that way. It was that it's handy, it's useful... "Oh, that tip is so clutch." I was like "Oh, interesting." But yeah, no, I mean, English is a fascinating language, and from my understanding, one of the reasons why it's dominated the world besides like colonization and all of that jazz is it's able to absorb other languages very easily.

**Jerod Santo:** It's malleable.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, very malleable. And it takes in -- it's very flexible rules-wise. If anybody else speaks other languages, you know how English feels so much more aerated than other languages. And so yeah, it's pretty cool.

**Jerod Santo:** It is cool. Somebody in our Zulip was hating on English the other day, and I was just like -- I was just going to hop in there and be like "I love English."

**Amal Hussein:** English is the best. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** But I didn't want to be like that, so I didn't say it... But I'm saying it now. English is awesome.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** We take other words and we just use them.

**Kevin Ball:** But it's also very morphable, right?

**Jerod Santo:** It makes it hard to learn.

**Kevin Ball:** I listen to my children as preteens now, and I wonder if I speak English. It doesn't seem to be the same English they're speaking.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Exactly. Exactly. And then there's pidgin English. There's actually official pidgin English'es too, all over the Caribbean, and many parts of Africa.

**Nick Nisi:** And JavaScript.

**Amal Hussein:** Right. Funny. Yeah, that too. But you know what? I will say this... Certain things are very hard to say in English succinctly. I'd say like English isn't maybe the best when it comes to the richness of vocabulary. I think other languages do a better job at like -- there's like 50 words for one thing in certain languages, depending on the context, and whatever... And that richness and depth of language is kind of missing from English, I feel. It takes many words to say something sometimes, and in other languages you just have to say a word.

**Christopher Hiller:** For some people more than others.

**Amal Hussein:** Yes, yes. Like myself. Like myself.

**Jerod Santo:** I was just thinking, I love how long it's taken her to explain this.

**Amal Hussein:** Well, you know, I'm... Deductive? Inductive communicator?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Amal -v. Go.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, -v. -verbose.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Give us all the words. I think my favorite new word to say or to use is like "Spam those buttons." We play a lot of Switch, and we're like spamming the buttons... That's a cool reuse that's like on it, but makes it fun again. It's not like a bad connotation. It's a fun connotation. And like "sigma". I have no idea what it means, but it's cool. It sounds cool. It's like, that sounds cool.

**Jerod Santo:** And Rizzler.

**Christopher Hiller:** My seven-year-old doesn't call things dumb or stupid. He only says "derpy".

**Amal Hussein:** Derpy?

**Jerod Santo:** Something's derpy? Does that come from like herpa derpy?

**Christopher Hiller:** It came from the derp meme. The Mega Man or whatever, with the eyes...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we've got to end this show, because we are showing our age...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I thought it was over.

**Jerod Santo:** Thanks guys for playing Friendly Feud with us. It was fun. We did ask way more questions than just these, so we can play some more games without having to do more surveys... So stay tuned for more Friendly Feud in the future. Future Friendly Feud. Bye, friends.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends. I'm showing you my hand, see? I'm non-threatening. Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, stop threatening people.
