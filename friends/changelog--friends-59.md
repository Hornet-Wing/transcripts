**Jerod Santo:** Hello and welcome back to \#define, also known as hash-define in less sophisticated areas, or octothorpe-define, if you're into obscure made-up words, which we certainly are. And this game is all about obscure words and what they mean... Also, what they don't mean, as our intrepid contestants will be rewarded for lying, like skilled politicians. I'm Jerod Santo, your host on this ridiculous ride, and playing this round, it's our returning champion, Thomas Eckert. Welcome back, Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Happy to be back, and in the graces of some more legends, and maybe a future legend in Carol.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hmm. Speaking of Carol, she will be playing the role of the noob, a.k.a. the doctor. It's Carol Lee, PhD. Welcome, Carol.

**Carol Lee:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you excited? Are you scared?

**Carol Lee:** You know what? I'm just taking it how it goes. I know Taylor's like a chaos machine, so I'm just prepared for chaos. That's all I'm ready for.

**Taylor Troesh:** Chaos machine...

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor is a chaos machine. He's also a winning machine. He's previously won this game as well. So we have a few champions here. Of course, you're referring to Taylor Troesh. What's up, man?

**Taylor Troesh:** Whaddup?!

**Jerod Santo:** How are you feeling? Are you feeling ambitious, or mischievous, or both?

**Taylor Troesh:** I am feeling -- no, I'm definitely feeling mischievous.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Taylor Troesh:** I don't want to win, I just want everyone to lose.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. He just wants to see the world burn. One of those kind of guys.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair enough. Well, speaking of burning - that doesn't even make sense... It's Mat Ryer. Hey, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Hello. Thank you. It was a good link. Good to be here.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Good to have you. How are you feeling today?

**Mat Ryer:** Good old Mat Fire. It does work, actually, if you do it like that.

**Jerod Santo:** Nice.

**Mat Ryer:** I've saved you.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm not feeling great, I'll be honest. I'm jet-lagged. I've been in San Francisco recently, and... Yeah. And then when you come back, nothing makes sense. Like, I know what time is on the clock, but it doesn't feel right. You sort of have a feeling of the time. I can't feel the date.

**Carol Lee:** It's a convenient excuse. I like it.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Mat's already getting his excuses lined up.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That's why I'm going to definitely lose. No, but I will take it seriously. I'm going to try and win. I played against Thomas last time, and I don't know, this wasn't made clear at the beginning, but it seems like he might be educated. And I think that's --

**Jerod Santo:** Which we found was an unfair advantage.

**Carol Lee:** Educated people are the worst.

**Jerod Santo:** It's true. Carol's actually the most educated. Although Taylor, do you have a PhD?

**Carol Lee:** I'm not a very competitive person. I'm just kind of in it to have fun, so... I feel like Taylor's the one you have to watch out for.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll tell you who you have to watch out for. It's the man who hasn't made a noise yet, because he's over there, strategizing. It's Adam Stacoviak. What's up, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, I'm just thrilled to be here, on this very awesome game show... It is an incredible opportunity, and I'm feeling both excited, and I'm just being honest, just a little bit nervous today.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can't wait to see what happens today.

**Thomas Eckert:** Now, Adam, if you were to get an honorary PhD based on the things you know how to do, what would your PhD be in?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, great question. I would have to say a PhD in BS.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Well, that should play to your strengths in this game, shouldn't it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** And by BS, I mean Brain Science.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, Okay.

**Carol Lee:** That was cute. That was cute.

**Jerod Santo:** That was some good BS right there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:07:48.23\] Well, let me briefly describe the game, and then we will get right into it. This is the game of fake definitions. We have 10 rounds of play, or 15 points scored will win; if you can get that done prior to 10 rounds, good on you. The way it works is I will present a word, and the five of you will submit to me fake definitions of that word, unless you happen to know exactly what it means... You can submit to me the correct definition and I will award you with three points immediately. If not, fake definitions are submitted, I gather them, I read them aloud in randomized orders, and then we go around the circle and see who can guess the correct definition. If you get it right at that point, you get two points. If somebody else picks your fake definition, you get one point per person, unless it's yourself. And we have a lot of fun along the way. Any questions before we hop into round one?

The one bit of context here is the default style of word is STEM. So science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We also include science fiction and fantasy, just to broaden it slightly... But there are also non-STEM rounds, where any word will work, and I will let you guys know what those are as we go. But first round is a normal round, and your word for round one is cavorite. Cavorite. That's C-A-V-O-R-I-T-E. Please submit to me your definitions now.

There are no bonus points for submitting first... But Adam will probably submit last. I have Carol... I have Thomas's, Mat's, and Taylor's...

**Thomas Eckert:** Now, Mat, what brought you to San Francisco?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I have friends there...

**Thomas Eckert:** And --

**Mat Ryer:** Well, don't be so surprised by that, Thomas...

**Thomas Eckert:** No, I'm not surprised. I'm just --

**Carol Lee:** It's a surprise, I know. It's so weird.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That was a bit...

**Carol Lee:** Say more.

**Mat Ryer:** So I went to see them. That's nice, thanks. But I went in a Waymo also, the self-driving taxi. Genuinely --

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh. Across the ocean?

**Mat Ryer:** No -- it was surprisingly good.

**Carol Lee:** Well, where were your expectations that made it surprisingly good?

**Mat Ryer:** Expectations probably were high, because of Knight Rider, and the sci-fi -- I sort of already expect we should have this. So I'm a bit annoyed that all cars need to have a person in them, making them do it... So this was just doing it on its own, though. It was like a ghost was driving... Except I don't believe in ghosts. So a spirit...?

**Jerod Santo:** So you don't believe in ghosts, but you do believe in spirits?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, anyway, it was driving itself, up the steep hills... It was like a roller coaster at times. Up the steep hills in San Francisco, and down them, and you just think hopefully it knows to stop... You know, you imagine some of the code in there "if hill, go slow on it, and stop when bottom." I don't know what language that is, but something like that; that's pseudocode.

Imagine though, it just drives around. You don't have to talk to anyone... I think it's the future, and I wish all cars were like this now already.

**Taylor Troesh:** I want to take this time to coin a phrase. I think we should be calling self-driving cars - we should be calling them autos.

**Carol Lee:** Oooh...! That was \[unintelligible 00:11:06.13\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** What about just automobile?

**Jerod Santo:** It's already a word.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, it's literally true.

**Taylor Troesh:** I know, but like, it's fell out of fashion. People don't say auto anymore. Like, if somebody is like "Excuse me sir, would you would you like to get in my vehicle?" I'd be like "No, thanks."

**Jerod Santo:** Just don't call them automagical and I'll be fine, okay? Let's see what our definitions were for round one. Our word was caverite. Now, a quick disclaimer. As your humble host, it's difficult to read some of these definitions without laughing. My laughter does not indicate a fake definition. Every once in a while, I will laugh at the real definition in order to confound you.

**Mat Ryer:** Question. Do you find the dictionary funny?

**Jerod Santo:** Sometimes...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Carol Lee:** I'm really curious about your fake laugh at the real definition.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:12:00.15\] Oh, you won't know when it hits.

**Carol Lee:** We'll see.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's something that a caverite would do...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm a PhD in BS, so... You will not know. Alright, let's read our fake definitions and our real definition to the best of our ability. I will now maximize this so, I can't see your faces... Caverite, a type of equestrian gate between a trot and a gallop, named for its cavorting nature. That's number one. Number two, a proprietary fixative used in dental practices to fix cavities. It was marketed with the slogan "Caverite, keeps your smile bright." That's a nice slogan. Number three, a style of hat made popular in the 1950s by Bridget Biscowit and the Boomtown Band. Number four, somebody who stays out late at night. Number five, when used in a sentence, it is often included with the word cave. This is due to the -- \[laughter\] Who's laughing?

**Thomas Eckert:** \[unintelligible 00:13:00.27\] Close.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. This is due to nature of the root word, cav, or atoos, which means to be in a cave. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** That's useful though, to have a word that means both cave, or in a cave.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. That means to be in a cave that is virtually impossible of collapsing. Alright, so there's the differentiator. It's a cave that cannot collapse. Or, number six, a fictional material that has the ability to negate the force of gravity. Those are six definitions for the word caverite. Some better than others. Let's see what you all think. We'll start with Carol. Which do you think is the correct definition?

**Carol Lee:** I think it's the last one.

**Jerod Santo:** The last one. The fictional material, that has the ability to negate the force of gravity?

**Carol Lee:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. We go now to Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Hmm. I was also leaning there, but I've got to be careful to not trigger the pile-on song.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's pretty early for a pile-on.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Round one pile-on. You can't do that.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. It could be people who are out late at night... Caverite. What was the the equestrian one? Is it a type of gate that the --

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. It's between a trot and a gallop, name for its cavorting nature.

**Thomas Eckert:** G-A-I-T.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, G-A-I-T.

**Thomas Eckert:** Mm-hmm.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I thought it was literally a big fence for holding in horses.

**Carol Lee:** And for the listeners, caverite is spelled favorite with a C. It's a really dumb word. I'm already against it.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Already against it. Alright... Thank you for that context.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Why wouldn't it be cavorite then? Cavorite, not caverite.

**Jerod Santo:** It's not Taylor's caverite...

**Taylor Troesh:** It's not my caverite word.

**Carol Lee:** Your favorite caverite?

**Jerod Santo:** Thomas?

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm going to say it's a person who stays out late at night.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's number two?

**Jerod Santo:** That's number four. Number two was the fixative using dental practices. Alright, we go now to Mat. Which do you think is the correct definition?

**Mat Ryer:** I was swung by -- I was interested in the same answers, the same options as Thomas.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So four and six.

**Mat Ryer:** But then I learned that gates meant way to walk...

**Jerod Santo:** And it changed everything for you.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That made me think it's even more that. That sounds even more like something. But there's also something... Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm going to go with the last one. It won't be a pile-on, as we know, but I'm going to go with the fictional thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat goes with the fictional thing.

**Mat Ryer:** Carol's got a PhD, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Now let's go to Taylor.

**Mat Ryer:** You don't have to get a PhD if you just copy what someone else with a PhD does.

**Carol Lee:** My PhD is in psychology, for the record, so...

**Thomas Eckert:** I gave everyone a master's degree last time.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true.

**Mat Ryer:** That's true. I forgot to use mine, actually...

**Jerod Santo:** Unfortunately, I defenestrated mine.

**Thomas Eckert:** \[00:15:57.13\] You defenestrated yours, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well... I didn't like it. Taylor, which are you going to go with?

**Taylor Troesh:** Bridgerton Boom Boom.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Okay. That's number three, the style of hat made popular by Bridgerton Boom Boom...

**Carol Lee:** I believe it was the Boom Band, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam, it's your turn to guess, sir.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Can I hear number five again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Do I have to?

**Carol Lee:** Yes...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I just want to know what it says.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh. When used in a sentence, it is often included with the word cave. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's included with it. I've never heard... You're saying you have to --

**Carol Lee:** \[unintelligible 00:16:36.15\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's like, you say "Cave, caverite, cave." \[laughs\] Do you want me to read the rest of that?

**Mat Ryer:** Also, why do you need the word "cave" if that means that as well?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it's a cave impossible of collapsing. So it's a caverite cave.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. The whole definition, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to go with that one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** He wants to hear the whole definition.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you want to hear the whole thing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Ah, this is due to the nature of the root word, cav or atus, which means to be in a cave that is virtually impossible of collapsing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's a very good fake if that's not real, isn't it?

**Jerod Santo:** Adam picks that one.

**Carol Lee:** It's excellent.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, let's start right there. Adam thinks caverite means...

**Carol Lee:** Read the definition.

**Jerod Santo:** ...when used in a sentence, it's often used with the word cave. I don't know, he wrote it himself. That's your own one.

So you both made me read it, and then you selected it, and you get zero points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's just too good. It's just too good.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't understand the logic to that one.

**Carol Lee:** Well, you should have pride in your work, so we'll give that to him.

**Taylor Troesh:** He tricked himself.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it was just one of those things.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** It was, wasn't it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That one's for the show.

**Jerod Santo:** Thomas thought maybe caverite meant somebody who stays out at night. Taylor wrote that one, so one point for Taylor.

**Thomas Eckert:** Nice one, Taylor.

**Jerod Santo:** And Taylor thought it was the Bridgerton hat, but that one was Mat's, so one point for Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Boomtown Band.

**Carol Lee:** Boomtown Band. Classic.

**Taylor Troesh:** That was a good one. That was a very good one.

**Jerod Santo:** How do you pronounce that word, Bridget Biscowit?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know, I just put in loads of letters and left it for you to worry about.

**Jerod Santo:** You're making my job harder over here.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yup...

**Jerod Santo:** And then almost a pile on, but not quite. Carol and Mat both went with a fictional material that has the ability to negate the force of gravity. That is caverite. First depicted by HG Wells in his 1901 scientific romance, The First Men in the Moon.

So Carol and Mat both scored two points there, giving Mat three for the round. Carol, two. Taylor, one. Adam and Thomas with zero. I also scored zero. I did not mention that caveat... If nobody picks the correct definition, I score three points for the round, which - I'm at zero. And so after round one, Mat in first with three, Carol with two, Yaylor with one. We move now to round two. This is a non-STEM round, so broaden your horizons. And your word for round two is gallimaufry. That's spelled G-A-L-L-I-M-A-U-F-R-Y. Gallimaufry.

**Taylor Troesh:** F-R-Y?

**Jerod Santo:** F-R-Y.

**Taylor Troesh:** Not P-H-R-E-Y?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Taylor Troesh:** I have no idea of that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** If it was PH, would you have an idea?

**Jerod Santo:** That F really rocked your world, Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, dude...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, please submit your fake definitions now.

**Mat Ryer:** I wish those letters were all different letters. Then I'd have an idea what this word meant.

**Carol Lee:** Not to make everyone self-conscious, but I really enjoy... I know I said this earlier, but I like everyone's thinking faces... And like what you look like when you're thinking... And Taylor always looks so concerned.

**Jerod Santo:** He does.

**Carol Lee:** He's really sweet.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. He furls his brow.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. \[laughs\] Like, it's going to be okay, Taylor... You got it.

**Taylor Troesh:** \[00:20:01.08\] Yeah... I get in trouble at home. My wife's like "We're gonna have to pay for Botox if you keep on doing that." Because I just do it all day. I'm just like...

**Jerod Santo:** Resting furl face.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. But it has like a tinge of sadness to it, strangely.

**Jerod Santo:** It does.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Like, you don't look angry. Mat kind of looks angry.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I am.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I would say like maybe downtrodden. That's how you look.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Whereas Taylor, you kind of look like -- I don't know, writing sad things in your diary. Sad and deep things.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe he's just really upset with his definitions.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, that is true. I'm very, very upset with this definition. Oh, actually, I've got a good one now.

**Thomas Eckert:** Now, Carol, what is your PhD in?

**Carol Lee:** Clinical psychology.

**Thomas Eckert:** Okay, so that's why you're looking at everyone's face.

**Carol Lee:** Oh, yeah. It's what I do, I just look at people's faces.

**Mat Ryer:** Don't we have to accept cookies or something before you're allowed to do that? \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** That was pretty good.

**Mat Ryer:** It's like special skills. I used to think that on Star Trek, there's a character called Deanna Troi, and she would just read the emotions and stuff ,and just tell it --

**Jerod Santo:** She would.

**Mat Ryer:** Which is like "What are you doing? You can't do that. That's really, really invasive."

**Carol Lee:** Really invasive, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Weird.

**Jerod Santo:** Could she actually read minds?

**Mat Ryer:** No, just like feelings, and that.

**Jerod Santo:** She would just say like if he's lying, or if he's mad, or whatever.

**Mat Ryer:** She'd be like "Captain, he's going to blow our faces off?" And you're like "Deanna, that's his personal..." If I was Captain Picard, I'd be like "Deanna, don't invade his personal thoughts!"

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That's a really good point.

**Mat Ryer:** So yeah, but that's it. I run a different kind of ship to Captain Picard, I guess...

**Jerod Santo:** What kind of a ship do you run?

**Mat Ryer:** It'd have good morals, but I don't think it would be around for long, you know...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Unprecedented. Adam has submitted prior to somebody else.

**Mat Ryer:** Wow. Congrats, mate.

**Jerod Santo:** Unless - Taylor, did you submit yours? I didn't see it.

**Taylor Troesh:** No, no, I'm doing it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Because you said you were disappointed in --

**Thomas Eckert:** Watch his face. He's still --

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, yeah, he still looks concerned. He's obviously thinking. Come on.

**Jerod Santo:** Now he's going to be self-conscious because we're all staring at his face.

**Carol Lee:** I know. I'm sorry, Taylor. I'm sorry.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, no. It's the meta game.

**Jerod Santo:** He's playing the meta game. Yeah. The meta game is the best game.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Thomas just kind of looks chronically cheerful, I'm not going to lie.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, sorry.

**Carol Lee:** No, it's very sweet.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** You don't have to apologize for looking cheerful...

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, it's a good thing. You're so happy about your thinking.

**Thomas Eckert:** I like thinking.

**Mat Ryer:** Thomas looks low-res to me. Thomas, are you feeling alright? You look low-res.

**Thomas Eckert:** I feel a little low-res today. I got not a great sleep, and I feel maybe I'm getting sick. But I'm in the denial phase, so...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's the different phases of being sick, yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm in the denial phase until... Suddenly, I'm not. I'm like "It's allergies, it's allergies."

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, here comes Taylor's.

**Mat Ryer:** Your leg's off. "It's allergies..." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, boy... Okay, we now have all of our definitions for round two. This is a non-STEM word. Gallimaufry. Gallimaufry. Hard to say. Easy to define for Carol. She actually knew the definition of this one, so she sits this round out. She scores three points right off the bat, really moving herself into the lead... So you guys are playing catch up with Dr. Newb over there. Who should we read first? Let's read this one first. Gallimaufry - the back section of a Roman cathedral where communion is prepared.

**Carol Lee:** Where what is prepared?

**Jerod Santo:** Communion.

**Mat Ryer:** That's not that one then.

**Carol Lee:** I heard comedian. I was really confused.

**Mat Ryer:** No, they used to do stand-up before mass. It's like "Before we get to eating the cracker and having the thing... Yeah, here's our Roman stand-up."

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:23:55.27\] Number two. A dish made from a mixture of leftover food, especially meat and veggies. Number three - a concerned, pensive, downtrodden, forlorn face, that is bound to need Botox injections. Which some people are very, very self-conscious of... Carol, you meanie. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** I think that was the real definition.

**Carol Lee:** \[unintelligible 00:24:16.19\]

**Taylor Troesh:** That's why Carol knew it.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Number four - an originally Shakespearean character whose only purpose is to make another character trip or fall. And number five, a roofing material derived from aluminum.

**Carol Lee:** Did you say roofie or roofing?

**Jerod Santo:** A roofing material derived from aluminum.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Roofie...

**Jerod Santo:** There are your five definitions. Yeah, roofie material would be something entirely different. We will start with Thomas. You only have five to pick from, so it should be easier.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, I'm leaning towards the Shakespearean fall character. That seems like something that would show up in Shakespeare.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. It sounds like one of those funny English words from England, where they make up all kinds of things.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Mat, what do you think?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't remember any of them.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... I can reread some.

**Mat Ryer:** If you just give me a one-word...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, a one-word summary of each.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If you were ChatGPT, what would you --

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good challenge. Number one was communion.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two was leftover. Number three would be forlorn.

**Mat Ryer:** Forlorn face.

**Jerod Santo:** Number four would be Shakespearean...

**Mat Ryer:** Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** And number five would be aluminum.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I'm curious that you're saying aluminum. And that's hard for me to hear in an American accent. So I'll probably go for that one for that reason, and I think that's sound logic there, that play.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, fair enough.

**Mat Ryer:** I've got a BS in logic.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat picks aluminum.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** We move now to Taylor, who has a concerned, pensive, downtrodden, forlorn face as he tries to select --

**Taylor Troesh:** Gallimaufry face, yeah.

**Carol Lee:** He's quite gallimaufric, some might say...

**Mat Ryer:** Ooh. That's with the leather. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** It's a family podcast...

**Taylor Troesh:** Give me Shakespeare, brah.

**Jerod Santo:** Shakespeare it is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Shakespeare, brah."

**Jerod Santo:** We're one away from a pile-on here on Shakespeare... And then we go to Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Can I hear two different definitions again, please? Number two and I think number four...

**Jerod Santo:** Number two is a dish made from a mixture of leftover food, especially meat and vegetables. Number four was an originally Shakespearean character whose only purpose is to make another character trip or fall. What are you thinking?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking leftovers. Can't pile on. Anti pile-on.

**Jerod Santo:** No pile on. Adam goes for the leftovers.

**Mat Ryer:** He's got anti-pile cream. He's got anti-pile cream on himself.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've been lubing up with it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Family podcast.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So when I jump on the pile, I slip right off.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. No, I like this, because there's two people on this podcast that have said worse things than I've said.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a rare occasion.

**Mat Ryer:** And that makes me feel really safe.

**Jerod Santo:** We usually edit you pretty harshly.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm feeling pretty good. Yeah. You need that in jet lag. You sort of need a cuddle, don't you? You need more of a cuddle. Someone to put their arms around you and just be like "Don't worry. You're just jet-lagged."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Only if they're moisturized.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, moving on... Let's start right where Adam left off. Not with the moisturizer, but with a dish made from a mixture of leftover food, especially meat and vegetables. That's also known as a hodgepodge, or a hash, or a ragout, or a gallimaufry. That is correct, Adam.

**Mat Ryer:** Wow. I felt that was a bluff because of the fry at the end. The F-R-Y.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Like French fries?

**Mat Ryer:** No. Fry, like, you fry food, or you know...

**Taylor Troesh:** Stir fry.

**Mat Ryer:** Like a stir fry, yeah. A gallimaufry.

**Carol Lee:** Oh, like you fry the gallimauf. Got it, got it.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:27:59.18\] Yeah, exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** So Adam scores two points. Good job, dude. Got the correct answer there. Mat was tricked by aluminum, and Adam wrote aluminum. Did I read it correctly for you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** For me?

**Jerod Santo:** Did you spell it like that on purpose, or did you luck into it? Because that is the British English --

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's how I know how to spell it, okay? ...because of Johnny Ive.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Like, correct.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I only know how to spell aluminum because of Johnny Ive.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so you've been influenced by Johnny Ive. Makes sense. Well, it tricked Mat into picking it, so now you've got three points for the round.

**Mat Ryer:** But I forgive him immediately because of the aluminum correctness. Adam, you're always welcome in our country.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Thank you. Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** And there was a mini pile-on onto Shakespeare, this character who makes another character trip or fall. And that was Shakespearean Mat being Shakespearean himself.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, you cheeky bastard.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points for Mat...

**Mat Ryer:** Should have noticed the beard. A little Shakespearean beard...

**Jerod Santo:** It is very... Yeah, you kind of have a Shakespeare thing going on.

**Jerod Santo:** You do have a Shakespeare thing going on.

**Mat Ryer:** It's kind of Dogtanyan style.

**Jerod Santo:** Like Dan-Tan?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dan-Tan...!

**Thomas Eckert:** Dan-Tan! Coming this summer.

**Jerod Santo:** Carol has no idea what we're talking about.

**Carol Lee:** What is happening...?

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry. Dan-Tan's a callback joke. That's, uh...

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm curious... Question for Carol. How did you know this word? How did you come across this word in your life?

**Carol Lee:** I really like random books about \[unintelligible 00:29:20.11\] random Victorian times... And sometimes weird sh\*\* comes up, and then you've got to look up the word.

**Taylor Troesh:** Sounds like a PhD thing, dude.

**Carol Lee:** It is not a PhD thing.

**Taylor Troesh:** Books...

**Carol Lee:** Oh, books. So gross.

**Jerod Santo:** We didn't know that you read...

**Adam Stacoviak:** She did admit when she was on the show that she doesn't read many books.

**Carol Lee:** I don't read a lot of psychology books.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Psychology books.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** She reads a lot of mishmash jumbles, or gallimaufrys.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, \[unintelligible 00:29:42.01\] mishmash jumble of things.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm all romance novels, me.

**Carol Lee:** I can see that. I can see that.

**Jerod Santo:** You write romance novels?

**Mat Ryer:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** Do you use a pen name?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He, uh, stars in them.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat Friar.

**Mat Ryer:** I star in them. It's just me in the book.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Another great day for old Mat Friar. Tyler, I like the way earlier you said -- sorry, was it Taylor? Taylor, sorry. What did I say.

**Jerod Santo:** You've given him a forlorn look on his face.

**Carol Lee:** I know...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh dear.

**Jerod Santo:** You meanie.

**Mat Ryer:** We have to be careful what we say to you. Like looking after a Tamagotchi now at this point. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** A Tamagotchi...

**Carol Lee:** Tamagotchi Taylor.

**Jerod Santo:** Tamagotchi Taylor.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. You've got to like give him some food. No, but I was going to say, earlier you were like -- how did you say it when you chose the Shakespeare one? It sounded like a kind of cool high school kid.

**Taylor Troesh:** Shakespeare, brah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he said "Shakespeare, brah."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It just sounded cool, like you're at the end of your rope at school, you're about to get kicked out, and a kindly teacher just somehow gets through to you, and it's a touching story.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly how it feels.

**Carol Lee:** And then he becomes like a Shakespearean scholar.

**Mat Ryer:** There you go. And that's it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Romeo and Julian, right? I love that book.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. You've modernized it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Modern? Nah, dude. I read it in the original Latin.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Take that, Mat! Well, Taylor has to do stuff like that, as he's in the rear here... One point so far, through two rounds...

**Carol Lee:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** He's only beating Thomas and myself, who are literally --

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, I think I'm in the rear.

**Jerod Santo:** ...in the cellar. Well, you know, there's the caboose, and then there's the rear. I don't know, these things are close together. In the middles, Adam with three, probably feeling pretty good about his three-point round... And Mat and Carol tied, with five after two rounds. We move now to round three.

**Break**: \[00:31:38.20\]

**Jerod Santo:** And your word for round three is bunyip. Bunyip. That's B-U-N-Y-I-P.

**Mat Ryer:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Yes.

**Thomas Eckert:** We're back to STEM. This is STEM. Is it?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. This is a regular round. Carol Lee is already typing, so she might know this one... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** From one of her random books.

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, guys, I don't want to scare you, but she's already submitting. Pretty fast for a fake definition.

**Carol Lee:** Maybe I just think of fake things really quickly. Or I like to draft a lot, and then choose the right one.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, so you like pre-write a bunch of definitions and then select. That's a strategy. There you go. Oh, no. Not in the group DM, Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** That was a fake one.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, okay.

**Taylor Troesh:** That was just for you guys.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor is now hiding, so we don't look at his face while he thinks.

**Carol Lee:** That's how you know he's in ultra forlorn mode.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** It's like playing poker, ain't it?

**Jerod Santo:** It's like when your Tamagotchi is at the brink of death.

**Carol Lee:** But look how happy Thomas looks while he's thinking. He's got like a little smile on his face. It's so cute. I can't handle it. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Thinking about stuff, just walking around...

**Carol Lee:** Thomas is like "Hmm... I wonder what this is." That's precious.

**Jerod Santo:** Look at Taylor. I think he's having a seizure. He's convulsing down there. \[laughter\] Oh, man... Now I'm just imagining each of you has different Tamagotchi characters. It's very odd. Thomas is just really easy to take care of...

**Carol Lee:** I didn't know there were Tamagotchi characters. I thought it was just like the little thing. Yeah. Isn't it just like a little blob?

**Jerod Santo:** It's a little pet. It's a little digital pet, right?

**Carol Lee:** Do they look different?

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like they had --

**Carol Lee:** I just thought they were --

**Jerod Santo:** Were they all the same thing?

**Carol Lee:** I'm gonna look it up.

**Jerod Santo:** I know that they had different personalities, right? Certain ones would need to eat more, other ones would sleep more...

**Carol Lee:** Oh, they do have different...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I feel like the people had --

**Carol Lee:** Is that new?

**Jerod Santo:** I didn't know there was new Tamagotchis. I just figured it was a 1990s thing.

**Carol Lee:** Someone told me that Tamagotchi is back. I don't know if that's true.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh.

**Carol Lee:** But I'm pretty sure they're back.

**Jerod Santo:** That would make sense. Everything comes back, eventually.

**Thomas Eckert:** I feel like it could just be like an app now.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** The fact that it's like its own separate thing is kind of cool. Retro.

**Mat Ryer:** It'd be cool if you could have yourself as a little Tamagotchi to look after though, ain't it? Like, I could have a little Jerod, and I've got to like feed him, clean up after him...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh. Not yourself, but other people. So you want to --

**Mat Ryer:** Well, that's yourself, isn't it, Jerod?

**Carol Lee:** You want Jerod to have a Jerod, or you want yourself to have a Jerod? I mean, both are creepy.

**Mat Ryer:** I wanna a little Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** He wants to have a little Jerod as his pet.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. No, Jerod having himself would be sad. Me having a little Jerod to look after, I think is --

**Carol Lee:** Also sad.

**Mat Ryer:** ...lovely.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Sad for whom?

**Mat Ryer:** That's especially brutal coming from an actual doctor in this stuff, truth be told.

**Carol Lee:** I'm sorry.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It somehow hits harder.

**Carol Lee:** I'm not gonna lie, the Tamagotchi characters are not that cute.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, they were just like little pixels, weren't they?

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Can I have a prescription to do something cool? I've got to get cool \[unintelligible 00:38:06.10\]

**Carol Lee:** You could adopt a little Jerod.

**Mat Ryer:** Just wear shades... Just wear shades at work.

**Carol Lee:** Oh, sorry, it's not that you're not uncool, it's that you're sad. Those are different, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, what's the opposite?

**Carol Lee:** But you're also uncool. Sorry. Sorry.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, right. Yeah. We'll deal with that one.

**Carol Lee:** They come together. They come together.

**Jerod Santo:** Shots fired.

**Taylor Troesh:** I just found out my mom's been lying to me for a long time. She's been telling me that I'm cool, but she's been telling other people that I'm lame. This is a...

**Jerod Santo:** Really?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, dude. This is a crisis. Recent crisis.

**Jerod Santo:** Who's she been telling this to?

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, she went on the news. She announced it in front of the public.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I saw that.

**Jerod Santo:** They just have a section of the news called like --

**Carol Lee:** Mom Thoughts?

**Taylor Troesh:** Who's lame, who's cool...

**Jerod Santo:** ...Diss on Your Kid... \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** "And now, to our mom correspondent..."

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well, maybe she just had to set the record straight. I mean, did she ask you to watch that particular program? Has anybody else submitted definitions? I have Thomas's, and Carol's is correct, so she's going to score more points again. But...

**Mat Ryer:** Wow, Carol. Do you get more points for getting it right?

**Jerod Santo:** You get three instead of two.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. If it makes you feel any better, Taylor, my mom told me my middle name was Sarah, and then when I got married, my birth certificate just had the letter J. And I was like "Who's Carol J. Lee?" It was just the letter. And she was like "They messed it up... Never bothered fixing it." So my middle name is just a random letter.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, that's so cool.

**Carol Lee:** I know. It was very confusing when I was -- I was like "I don't even know if you're marrying the right person, Zach. I'm so sorry."

**Taylor Troesh:** It's like you're destined to write a book now.

**Carol Lee:** "Finding Carol J. Lee."

**Taylor Troesh:** J. Lee, yeah. Not to one-up you, but my mom named me Trailer Trash, dude... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that is a one-upper, if I ever say one...

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, she had no clue.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that what she said on the news?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, no, no. That was like when I was in like elementary school. I was like "Hey, mom, why'd you name me Trailer Trash?" She's like "Oh, I could see how people would see that."

**Jerod Santo:** She didn't see that coming, huh?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:40:17.24\] I didn't put those two together until just now.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like I did, but also I feel like it might have been the first thing you ever said to me, Taylor, was that.

**Carol Lee:** Was "Hi, I'm Trailer Trash"?

**Jerod Santo:** No, I think I was interviewing you for the show and we were talking about your name, or something. Maybe it was prior to the show starting. Hopefully it wasn't on the air. But you were like "Yeah, Trailer Trash." I was "Okay..." \[laughs\] I wasn't going to say it, but you said it...

**Taylor Troesh:** There you go. Gotta clear the air.

**Jerod Santo:** And I think you had more of the look back then as well, didn't you? Do you still have the look?

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, yeah, I had the mullet.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** You had the mullet with the rat tail. You had the rat tail.

**Thomas Eckert:** There's no mullet, but do you have the rat tail?

**Taylor Troesh:** No rat tail right now. This weekend I actually had a mustache goatee thing. I was trying to look like somebody that would tie somebody to train tracks. And I successfully did it, \[unintelligible 00:41:08.18\] I did a song at a conference, and wanted to look like a villainous creature.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, now I have all definitions...

**Carol Lee:** I was explaining to someone how I knew you, and I was like "I met him at a conference. He had a hair tie. He had a fanny pack full of babies." And they were like "What does this person look like?" And I pulled up your picture, just from the internet... It was like you with the mullet, and the glasses... And they were like "This person looks like they would have a fanny pack of babies." And I was like "Yeah."

**Thomas Eckert:** A fanny pack of babies. That doesn't seem like you could carry a lot of babies. Are they very small --

**Carol Lee:** You'd be surprised.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, they're very small little plastic babies, and you slip them in people's pockets when nobody's looking.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam, didn't you take one of those home on the finger?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was really sad, because I wanted to get my finger out, my finger hand...

**Carol Lee:** The finger baby?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I have a mini finger hand, and a mini-mini finger hand.

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:42:03.14\] from Taylor.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. And I will tell you where they're at. At least one of them I know where it's at. Do you want to know where it's at? **Taylor Troesh:** No... The local dump?

**Jerod Santo:** Questionable...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's in the shower.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Wait a second. What...?!

**Mat Ryer:** I thought we were going there... The mini-mini one, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, the mini one is in the shower. The mini-mini one is lost.

**Jerod Santo:** Does it help you scratch your back, or something? I don't understand.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, my boys, they shower in our shower, because it's just easier, you know... And so they take things in there, and somehow they get left in there, and that's one of them. There's two monster trucks in there, and a mini finger hand.

**Mat Ryer:** A PS5... A Switch... "Who's left their Switch in here?"

**Thomas Eckert:** Kids...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we have all definitions for round three. Carol, correct again. Three points. She'll be sitting this round out.

Two rounds in a row, from the newb to the master. Perhaps we will see if this continues. Here we have five definitions of the word bunyip.

Number one, a mythical creature from Australian mythology said to lurk in swamps and rivers. Number two, the evolved ancestor of a bunny, which is the affectionate and informal name of a rabbit. Number three, a rocky enclave of a brook.

Number four, a misshapen egg or an egg that looks atypical. And number five, contractions of the core diaphragm in hares, similar to hiccups in humans. So there's five definitions of the word bunyip. Lots of rabbit connections there. And many of them. We will start with Mat. Bunyip.

**Mat Ryer:** Bunyip. Well, I was trying to read Carol... I knew that Carol knew the answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm. Metagame.

**Mat Ryer:** Yup. And got nothing. Couldn't tell you from any of them.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's what they train you to do. Clinical psychology.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's what they want me to think.

**Taylor Troesh:** I was doing the same thing. She just looked like a stone-faced Tamagotchi. Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** Nothing to read. The J stands for mystery.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, you have the same middle name as Sarah J. Moss. Did you realize that?

**Carol Lee:** \[00:44:18.06\] I do now. What does the J stand for in Sarah J. Moss?

**Taylor Troesh:** J, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** Just J.

**Taylor Troesh:** The programming language.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah. Mat, what are you thinking over there?

**Mat Ryer:** I'm going to go for the mythological one. The mythological one. Hey, last time I did this, being silly, they cut it out, thinking I was accidentally... I was going like \[00:44:42.05\] And the editor's like "Oh, we'll cut that out, because he's obviously made a little mistake..." But it was hilarious.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we can't tell when you're being real or not real with your mistakes. I mean, imagine you couldn't pronounce a word and then we left it in. The embarrassment.

**Mat Ryer:** That's what you do anyway. I'm British.

**Jerod Santo:** True. Moving to Taylor. Which of these definitions do you think is bunyip?

**Taylor Troesh:** I think it was the mythological one. Brook... River? River brook.

**Jerod Santo:** A rocky enclave of a brook...

**Taylor Troesh:** That sounds... Can't get anything from Stonewall Carol over there.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Stoneface Carol.

**Taylor Troesh:** What were the other ones? Give me give me the one word reviews...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so number two was the evolved ancestor of a bunny. Number four was a misshapen egg. And number five was the contractions of the core diaphragm in hares; in bunnies, in rabbits. Because a hair doesn't have a diaphragm.

H-A-I-R. Just closing that loop. What are you thinking, Taylor?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know much about hair...

**Taylor Troesh:** I am thinking -- my heart is telling me...

**Jerod Santo:** Tell us about your heart.

**Taylor Troesh:** Eggs, dude. We've gotta \[unintelligible 00:45:52.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** Eggs, dude. So far from Taylor we have "Shakespeare, brah" and "Eggs, dude." I'm liking these answers. Alright, a misshapen egg. Alright. Taylor is on eggs. Adam, where were you going to land?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm following Mat, because he's got the second most points, and he wrote the song Pile-on.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm. And you Taylor and Thomas are bad. These are our former champs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Thomas hasn't gone -- you haven't gone yet, have you, Thomas?

**Jerod Santo:** No, he hasn't.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I thought that was the case.

**Jerod Santo:** Just in general, I said you're following the leaders...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I'm following wisdom here... Or, wisdom... The aluminum wisdom. So whatever he chose. I don't even know which one he chose.

**Jerod Santo:** He chose the mythological creature. Australian myth.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sounds Australian.

**Jerod Santo:** One more and it's a pile-on. Well, there's only one more left. It's Thomas. Are you gonna pile on?

**Thomas Eckert:** That's a pile-on.

**Jerod Santo:** Is it a pile-on?

**Thomas Eckert:** It's a pile-on... I'm feeling it...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Now, should we play the pile-on jingle, or should we have Mat write a new one real quick?

**Carol Lee:** Write a new one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How about we have the live version? Give us the live version.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat, how about a pile-on jingle? Can you give us that?

**Carol Lee:** Even better.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you bring your guitar?

**Mat Ryer:** I've got my guitar here. This one's real.

**Jerod Santo:** Pile-on song part three.

**Mat Ryer:** That one's a Zoom background.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Maybe put a little bit of a -- some hare in it. A.k.a. bunny rabbit.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Give it a little bunny flavor.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Any other requests?

**Jerod Santo:** Eggs...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Make it fluffy... Yeah, with some eggs.

**Taylor Troesh:** Can you do Australian accent? Because we have...

**Carol Lee:** Australian \[unintelligible 00:47:21.27\] bunny fluff.

**Jerod Santo:** And if you can have the letter J in there...

**Mat Ryer:** In an Australian accent. Cool. Anything else?

**Jerod Santo:** We don't want to put too many constraints on you.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh no, please. \[laughter\] What constraints? Do it in an Australian accent, and make it about eggs and hares... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's pretty straightforward.

**Carol Lee:** No hoppy tune, by the way, you know...

**Adam Stacoviak:** How does an Australian say hare?

**Mat Ryer:** We're about to find out, mate...

\[00:47:49.24\] You're saying hare, I'm saying eggs...

I wish we were saying the all the same things again, but...

I don't know, mate... I guess it's not to be...

Oh wait a minute, you're changing your answer to be the same...

We got a Py-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-le-on. Mate.

We got a Py-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-le-on, mate.

We've got a Py-yi-le-on, mate...

We got a pile-on, mate... And I've got a fanny pack of babies...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Carol Lee:** That was really good.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, thank you very much. Yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** Mat, now that Oasis is getting back together, are you going to join them?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we're trying to get a support act, but so far they've not replied.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Did you see his face?

**Taylor Troesh:** I'm very excited about Oasis getting back together.

**Jerod Santo:** He was. He was excited.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... It's a wonder wall.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's go to our results of the pile-on. We had three out of the four guessing the mythical creature from Australian mythology. Carol, is that right?

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Carol knew that that was a bunyip. It's said to lurk in swamps and rivers. So Mat, Adam and Thomas each score two points. Taylor voted for the misshapen egg, dude. And that egg was Mat's egg, dude. So Mat gets a bonus point for tricking Taylor into selecting his definition. That's three for Mat. That's three for Carol.

**Mat Ryer:** I hope that's okay.

**Taylor Troesh:** Wait, it's not an egg?

**Mat Ryer:** No. I just made that up.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh. Shoot, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** "I just made that up." \[laughs\] Now, Carol couldn't remember what the monster looks like... So maybe it is an egg-shaped monster. I don't know.

**Carol Lee:** That's true. My definition said "Australian folk monster", but I don't know what it looks like. It could look like an egg.

**Jerod Santo:** And I've never seen one myself, so...

**Thomas Eckert:** Again, I have to ask, where have you encountered bunyip?

**Carol Lee:** Okay, I read a lot as a kid, also as a child...

**Thomas Eckert:** Alright, alright...

**Carol Lee:** And there was a book of folk monsters around the world.

**Mat Ryer:** You just remembered it from your childhood?

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a deep recall.

**Carol Lee:** It's kind of like a fun one, you know? It's a fun name.

**Jerod Santo:** Bunyip. I thought it was a fun word... Which is why I selected it.

**Carol Lee:** I mean, there's a reason why I don't remember what it looks like. I don't know.

**Thomas Eckert:** We all need to read more, so...

**Mat Ryer:** This is like Slumdog Millionaire, where Carol's got these backstories \[unintelligible 00:50:22.25\]

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, I know... But you're going to ask like a techie question and I'm going to be like "I don't know..."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Or a clinical psychology word comes up.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we move now to round four. Of course, between Carol's correct answers and Mat tricking everybody, those two are tied still at first place with eight. So she's not running away with it.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a battle between good and evil.

**Carol Lee:** It is, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a battle between knowledge and misinformation played out right here.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Isn't it? And I'm on the wrong side of history.

**Carol Lee:** I think that means you're going to win. Damn.

**Jerod Santo:** And I was going to say, we always know which one wins in the end...

**Thomas Eckert:** That's a British \[unintelligible 00:50:51.16\]

**Carol Lee:** Aw, sad... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's move to round four. This round is called Give It a Goog. Give It a Goog.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** This is an abnormal round. Now, I went to google.com... Have you heard of it? And I opened it in an incognito window, and I began to type something, and I stopped. And Google dutifully recommended me some autocompletes. I took the top autocomplete and I wrote it down. Your job in this round, Give It a Goog, is to write your own top autocomplete for this phrase, and we will select which one we think is the real autocomplete.

The phrase I typed into google.com was "Why don't we." "Why don't we", and then I stopped, and I wrote down that top autocomplete. Now, do not go out to Google and try this for yourself. That would be...

**Mat Ryer:** Immoral.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:51:52.28\] Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That'd be on the dark side, for sure. But go ahead and tell me what you think is the top autocomplete, and we can see which one's correct. I have Mat's...

**Taylor Troesh:** Now I'm wondering if like my thinking face is adequately joyful... I think there's a little bit more demure there.

**Carol Lee:** Don't think about it too much. I'm sure it's fine.

**Taylor Troesh:** Alright.

**Mat Ryer:** It still looks low-res to me. Have you had a Tylenol?

**Taylor Troesh:** I need a Tylenol... I was going to take one before the show, but I...

**Mat Ryer:** Get one.

**Taylor Troesh:** I'm in a neighbor's house. You might have missed it, but I'm in a neighbor's house, because they're testing the fire alarms in my apartment today.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh.

**Taylor Troesh:** They work.

**Mat Ryer:** They're just going around setting fires?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yes.

**Mat Ryer:** They're just setting a little fire and see

**Taylor Troesh:** No, they've got a guy who's smoking. He just walks around smoking all day.

**Mat Ryer:** Ah, he's cool. He looks cool, but...

**Taylor Troesh:** He looks cool, but it's really... Not cool.

**Mat Ryer:** Is it not?

**Taylor Troesh:** Not in the --

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, set a good example.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. It's a family show. Smoking kills.

**Mat Ryer:** Especially if it's you that's on fire, that's making the smoke.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's true. Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** That can be really dangerous. So do be careful if you're doing that.

**Jerod Santo:** I have Carol's Goog.

**Mat Ryer:** Thomas, I think I can detect your submissions in this game now, because of the way you write it. So I think Thomas has a tell now. So I'd like to play an additional game, where I --

**Carol Lee:** Does he look extra happy? What is the tell?

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, what is the tell?

**Mat Ryer:** It's in the definition itself.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, say more.

**Mat Ryer:** It just has a feeling. It just sounds like Thomas would say it.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's a vibe? It's a vibe check.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a vibe, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** She's using that phrase, Jerod. Say more.

**Carol Lee:** I know. I use it a lot. A classic therapy technique. Looking at faces and saying "Say more."

**Thomas Eckert:** And how does identifying my tell make you feel?

**Carol Lee:** It makes me feel pretty powerful, Thomas. Thank you for asking. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Are you sure she's on the good side or the evil side?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh...

**Thomas Eckert:** She's on her own side.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We are outnumbered here.

**Jerod Santo:** That was sinister. I liked it. Okay, we have them all. Why don't we give it a Goog? Oh, we did. And we were playing around. As a result, when we tried to autocomplete the phrase "Why don't we", here are six possible top autocompletes. Number one, "Why don't we live on Mars?" Number two, "Why don't we drugs legal?" Number three, "Why don't we print more money?" Number four, "Why don't we eat turkey eggs?" Number five, "Why don't we destroy the moon once and for all?" \[laughs\] Sorry. Number six. Just the way I said that was... "Once and for all..." "Why don't we see dead people?" That's number six. So we have six potential autocompletes. Taylor, which one do you think is the real one?

**Taylor Troesh:** Eggs!

**Jerod Santo:** Wow, you're very excited about eggs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Something's up with him and eggs.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Almost blew your mic out.

**Thomas Eckert:** Bunyip, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Taylor picks eggs. Emphatically. Adam picks...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can't choose. Is somebody trying to blow up the Moon?

**Jerod Santo:** Once and for all...

**Carol Lee:** Once and for all. That's the key piece here.

**Mat Ryer:** It's like, we've tried... Yeah, it's like we've tried and it keeps coming back.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, of course we've tried...

**Mat Ryer:** We're like "Ah, pesky Moon... Not again..."

**Jerod Santo:** We've tried everything. At least once.

**Mat Ryer:** We're just tired of all the tides...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, actually, once and for all kind of implies that we did do it once, but it came back, you know? It's like, we blew it up, but it wasn't once and for all. It was kind of like...

**Taylor Troesh:** Michael Collins knew the truth...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Does that make any sense though, once and for all? Because that would imply you didn't do it before. You've only done it once, and for all.

**Jerod Santo:** No, we want to do it once and for all. We did it, but it wasn't once and for all.

**Mat Ryer:** It's twice then. He's got a point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I really wish we could do this once, and for all.

**Jerod Santo:** I think we should do it twice and for some.

**Carol Lee:** It would have to be like "Let's do it one more time and for all", or something.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay. Once more, and for all.

**Jerod Santo:** One last time, and everybody can partake.

**Carol Lee:** But people aren't known for being accurate when they're Google searching, so...

**Jerod Santo:** True.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Jerod, would you be opposed to reading them all again?

**Jerod Santo:** These are quick. I can read them all. For you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, please.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:56:09.14\] Alright. Number one was "Why don't we live on Mars?" Number two, "Why don't we drugs legal?" Number three, "Why don't we print more money?" Number four, "Why don't we eat turkey eggs?" Number five, "Why don't we destroy the moon once and for all?" Number six, "Why don't we see dead people?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** So many good choices here. Is that you, Thomas, drugs legal?

**Thomas Eckert:** No. No, that's not --

**Jerod Santo:** Is that subliminal messaging? I think it was subliminal messaging.

**Thomas Eckert:** No, I was just looking at it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Taylor's pretty excited about the eggs, though.

**Thomas Eckert:** It's my vibe.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You were wrong with the eggs before... You were wrong with the eggs before...

**Jerod Santo:** He was way off.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You might be good about eggs this time, Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** No, I wasn't. I use that word every single day, and it's correct usage, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** What, bunyip?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** It's just a local usage of the word, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe it's like an actual product, from where he's from.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Every day? Use it in a sentence then. Give it to me.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, oh, I cracked a bunyip.

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds like something on your foot.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, fine. I won't follow you then. You make no sense. Let's go with money.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Adam wants to go with money. Print mo money. Alright, next up. Carol.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Money, dude.

**Carol Lee:** I'm actually going to go with eggs, because I am kind of wondering, why don't we eat turkey eggs? So...

**Jerod Santo:** Who says we don't?

**Carol Lee:** I guess I don't. So why don't we commonly. Maybe more accurately it would be like "Why don't we commonly eat turkey eggs?"

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Carol goes for eggs. We are one away from a pile-on.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We do eat turkey though.

**Carol Lee:** We do eat turkey, Adam. That is correct.

**Thomas Eckert:** Haven't they given us enough?

**Carol Lee:** Never...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Turkeys are not like chickens. They don't do the whole -- whatever the process is to produce an egg that is a yolk, maybe; not a turkey in there.

**Thomas Eckert:** Ovulation?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Is that what happens? Is it ovulation?

**Carol Lee:** Are you trying to say that chickens don't lay eggs?

**Thomas Eckert:** No, he's saying turkeys don't lay eggs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think -- well...

**Carol Lee:** Oh, okay. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I think they do. I just wonder if like chickens...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm pretty sure turkeys lay eggs...

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...chickens lay eggs that don't have chickens in them.

**Thomas Eckert:** Mm-hm... Yes...?

**Carol Lee:** Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** And so we eat the ones that don't have chicken -- they're just the yolk. It's a premenopause, or something. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out a word that's like --

**Jerod Santo:** Premenopause? Alright. You're done.

**Carol Lee:** Chicken menstruation, correct.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. Exactly. It's something like that, right? Evolution.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Premenopause chickens.

**Carol Lee:** And so are you saying like turkeys are born, like in menopause, or...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I'm thinking that maybe just turkeys don't do what chickens do.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's not answer the question.

**Carol Lee:** Every egg is a winner, okay?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right!

**Jerod Santo:** Let's answer this question. Which goog is it? Somebody fact-check Adam while he's answering, because he just spat some real interesting science. It's Adam's turn still. Oh, no, you picked -- I'm sorry, you picked print more money.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** My bad. You were just talking... It's actually your turn, Carol.

**Carol Lee:** I already chose one. I chose the turkey egg thing, because I was like --

**Jerod Santo:** Well, then what's going on with me? It's Thomas's turn.

**Carol Lee:** I don't know. It's probably Thomas' or Mat's turn.

**Jerod Santo:** It's Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** It is my turn. Live on Mars... Was it live on Mars? What was the phrasing there?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Live on Mars.

**Thomas Eckert:** Why don't we live on Mars?

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Thomas Eckert:** I just feel like people would be googling that. "Why don't we live on Mars yet?" "Drugs legal", kind of the mess up of the... I don't know, print more money. I mean, I feel like people do ask that all the time, every day.

**Carol Lee:** Print money or drugs legal?

**Thomas Eckert:** Drugs legal and print money... That'd be great. They go well together.

**Jerod Santo:** They do go hand in hand.

**Thomas Eckert:** Mm-hm. I think I'm going to ask "Why don't we live on Mars?" Why don't we live on Mars? It's there... It's not that far... Let's get over there.

**Taylor Troesh:** The Moon's closer.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm pretty sure they don't have oxygen.

**Carol Lee:** But we want to get rid of the Moon, once and for all.

**Thomas Eckert:** Well, that's because it's in the way. Once you get rid of the Moon, it's a straight shot to Mars.

**Carol Lee:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:59:54.08\] I think David Bowie - didn't he? He lived some life on Mars, didn't he? Mat, it's your turn. What are you thinking?

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Hang on a minute. So you did it in incognito mode...

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Mat Ryer:** And this is so that your previous search history didn't influence it.

**Jerod Santo:** It's not influenced by my personal interests.

**Mat Ryer:** But they do it on IP still. So what sort of -- tell me about the area you live in. Where do you live, Jerod? What street?

**Taylor Troesh:** Lots of anti-moon sentiment in this area...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Carol Lee:** People do a lot of drugs, and then print money, and then go to the Moon, and blow it up, then live on Mars and eat their turkey eggs, obviously...

**Jerod Santo:** It's a plan.

**Thomas Eckert:** I mean, the Moon might be the one place that's more barren than Nebraska, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Ouch, dude. Come on. We've got fertile cropland here. It's called the fertile plain for a reason, Thomas. Come on.

**Carol Lee:** Fertile, yeah. They can grow whatever the hell they want. Taylor's the one who's starving in like Palm Springs. Geez.

**Thomas Eckert:** More drugs. Drugs legal.

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know if it would make that mistake. Why would it not be correct English? I don't understand why the autocomplete \[unintelligible 01:00:54.27\]

**Taylor Troesh:** That's fine English. It's just American English.

**Jerod Santo:** And it's also a Nebraska thing.

**Carol Lee:** It's Nebraska American English...

**Mat Ryer:** I like the "Why don't we see dead people?" But the obvious answer is they're terrible on dates. But I think I'm going for print more money. I think most people would just be like... If you understand economics and the tools that they have at that level, you do talk about printing money... But also, if you're an absolute idiot - and I'm not saying you've got a lot of idiots in Nebraska. I don't know. But imagine there's an idiot walking down the street, who just thinks money's just printed, and they've got like a printer... Why don't they just do more of it, and then everyone's got more money?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, \[unintelligible 01:01:38.01\] that one.

**Mat Ryer:** That's my submission.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Print more money. Good one. Good one. We'll go with that one. My particular answer to that is aren't they already doing that? Aren't we printing more money? It seems like we are printing more money.

**Mat Ryer:** You can't be reply guys to Google autocomplete.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm replying to your thought process. Go ahead, Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, there's only so much paper. That's the problem. They're hitting the max in paper production.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] What we need is more trees. That's true.

**Mat Ryer:** Trees. Yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's why they're cutting down the trees, guys.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, that's why the Save the Rainforest people - we have to ignore them, because we have to cut down more trees if we want to print money.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's why they have so much money.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we've resorted to selling our printers that print the money. We actually make more money that way now.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's find out our results here... Print more money - we'll start right there, because that's where everybody wants to be. Adam and Mat, print more money. Why don't we? Well, Thomas, why don't we print more money? You were wondering that when you wrote that, weren't you? That's Thomas's.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points to Thomas. Thomas said "Why don't we live on Mars?" He wants to know. The people demand an answer. And that was Mat's question as well. So one point for Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Trade you. Touché.

**Jerod Santo:** Meanwhile, nobody picked "Destroy the Moon once and for all", much to Taylor's chagrin. And nobody picked "see dead people", much to Adam's chagrin. Nobody picked "Why don't we drugs legal", because Carol typed it wrong, or something...

**Carol Lee:** I feel like people can't type right on Google. Okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, was that on purpose?

**Carol Lee:** I was just speaking to the people.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Carol Lee:** Come on.

**Jerod Santo:** I wasn't sure if that was a typo or not. I was going to help you correct it.

**Taylor Troesh:** That was very good.

**Jerod Santo:** But that leaves us with the one real question that demands an answer... "Why don't we eat turkey eggs?"

**Carol Lee:** Is the answer because of Mat or Adam's strange conspiracy theory about turkey fertility?

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know. Adam, did you look it up while you were sitting there?

**Thomas Eckert:** Postmenopausal...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I just hypothesized that they fertilize less. But it turns out they just lay less.

**Jerod Santo:** Lay less eggs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. So I was thinking -- I used menopause; I couldn't think of the word fertilization. I'm sorry, everybody.

**Taylor Troesh:** Is that why we don't eat hummingbird eggs?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I think it'd be more like caviar, wouldn't it? I mean, they're tiny.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, but what if they lay like a ton of them? This could be an untapped natural resource.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, they're a lot harder to catch than chickens...

**Mat Ryer:** You just have a fist of them after the gym.

**Carol Lee:** I guess turkey eggs are kind of expensive. It's like $3 an egg.

**Taylor Troesh:** How much are hummingbird eggs?

**Carol Lee:** I don't know. Why don't you look it up?

**Jerod Santo:** Why don't you google it?

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's probably like rice, where you just get it by the --

**Thomas Eckert:** By the pound, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So Carol gets it right. Two points for Carol.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:04:13.27\] And Taylor gets it right. Two points for Taylor. Now, there were a few other contenders that I thought it would be fun to read... Not number one, of course. Number one was "Why don't we eat turkey eggs?" Number two, "Why don't we go back to the Moon?" So opposite of destroying it... \[laughter\] Number three, "Why don't we fly over Antarctica?" Good question. Number four, "Why don't we eat roosters?" Maybe this is Nebraska.

**Mat Ryer:** You're never going to get asked that in the UK. We've never even heard of a rooster.

**Jerod Santo:** Number five, "Why don't we talk about Bruno?" Good question. "Why don't we talk about Bruno?"

**Mat Ryer:** That's probably universal...

**Jerod Santo:** Number six, "Why don't we eat carnivores?"

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 01:04:50.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's not even true. It's not even true.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. But no one's going to search in the UK "Why don't we eat turkey eggs?" No one would say so, I promise.

**Jerod Santo:** Because you guys don't have turkeys?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we don't really eat much turkey.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Only at Christmas.

**Taylor Troesh:** I've heard that there's a difference of eggs in the UK versus the US, and you can just eat raw eggs in the UK, and you can't in the US... I'm not sure. I heard that.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that true, Mat?

**Mat Ryer:** You don't eat raw eggs?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, salmonella... We've been told they have salmonella poisoning. Do you guys have that over there, too?

**Mat Ryer:** It's suspicious. We've been told about the salmonella, but...

**Jerod Santo:** But I've seen Rocky, and he drinks a bunch of eggs and he's fine.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, people do it in the gym. I don't know if it's hummingbird... Do they just do that? Drink hummingbird juice...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think hummingbird eggs are too small, Taylor. There's not enough in there.

**Mat Ryer:** There's a sparrow that has really soft feathers on its chin, and there was some old emperor somewhere had a whole bed made from the softest possible sparrow chin feathers. And I really want one of them now, since I learned about it.

**Jerod Santo:** Believe it or not, we're only through four rounds...

**Taylor Troesh:** I want to own a very cold sparrow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** A cold sparrow...

**Jerod Santo:** Carol's in striking distance. I'm not even engaging in that conversation. We are only through four rounds and we're talking about hummingbird eggs and cold sparrows... We should move on to round five. After four rounds, Carol, almost in striking distance of a win here with 10 points. Mat in second with nine, Adam in third with five, Thomas fourth with four, and Taylor with three. Now, you guys have been using the spread quite well. And I have zero points, because every round you have landed - somebody at least - on the answer.

**Break**: \[01:06:38.06\]

**Jerod Santo:** Round five is one of our newer style rounds. This is called Namespace Conflict. In this round I have gone out to the hub of gits and I have found a repository. I will tell you the name of that GitHub repository, and you will write the tagline/description. You know, whatever people would put in that tagline field on GitHub to describe their repository. And we'll see who can trick everybody into thinking theirs is the real repo tagline. Sound good?

**Mat Ryer:** Sounds very good, actually. I would say out of all the rounds, this one sounds the best.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you. I worked very hard on these for your pleasure. The repo that you will describe or tag is called Firecrawl.

Firecrawl. F-I-R-E-C-R-A-W-L, all one word, Firecrawl. Please write a tagline and submit it to me now.

**Mat Ryer:** Did you read about Firecrawl repo when you were a kid, Carol?

**Carol Lee:** It was actually in this children's book... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I thought it might be.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's how they make the babies really tough, is that you teach them crawl over the fire.

**Mat Ryer:** They're not that tough if they end up in a fanny pack...

**Thomas Eckert:** That's small. So small versus tough... Those are different words.

**Taylor Troesh:** Just to be clear, they weren't actual babies that I had.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, really? What, like plastic or something?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, they're plastic.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh.

**Taylor Troesh:** You buy them in bulk.

**Jerod Santo:** Where do you get those?

**Mat Ryer:** Bulk, he said. That's where you buy them.

**Carol Lee:** Babies.com?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, no, bookstore. I get it from the bookstore.

**Jerod Santo:** The bookstore?

**Taylor Troesh:** Amazon.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. They do books now? Does Amazon sell books now?

**Taylor Troesh:** I don't know, ask Carol.

**Jerod Santo:** She reads books...

**Taylor Troesh:** I go to the bookstore to get books. Taylor gets babies. It's fine, okay?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. "Hey, guys, you got any babies?"

**Jerod Santo:** To be clear, they're not real babies.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. Not real babies.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's not keep acting like they are.

**Mat Ryer:** Most of us already knew that, Jerod; that they weren't already babies. They weren't real babies. Plastic. Imagine if that makes it into the podcast.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, we're going to cut a lot of this one.

**Thomas Eckert:** Taylor, have you ever tried to use the plastic babies as currency, like get a cup of coffee? Be like "How many babies do I owe you?"

**Jerod Santo:** The hardest part about this show is the running jokes... When they run out of a cuttable segment. We can't cut the segment anymore. You know what I'm saying? So this part might suck, but we brought up dead babies, or...

**Carol Lee:** Well, no one said dead babies, Jerod.

**Mat Ryer:** Jerod...!

**Carol Lee:** Jerod...!

**Jerod Santo:** Someone did say dead babies.

**Carol Lee:** No... There was not real babies, and there was plastic babies, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** Somebody said dead babies. I think it was Mat.

**Carol Lee:** Oh, my God...

**Jerod Santo:** I believe it was Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** In my imagination, they were only suffering.

**Jerod Santo:** I now have all five submissions. Let's play a game of namespace conflict. There is a repo on GitHub called Firecrawl.

Here are six potential taglines for Firecrawl. Number one, "Crawling through firewalls since 2001." Number two, "A full text search capabilities built for Firebase." Number three, "The missing search solution for Firebase." Number four, "Turn entire websites into LLM-ready Markdown or structured data. Scrape, crawl, and extract, with a single API." Number five, "Firefox extension for crawling URLs." And number six, monitoring for Firebase websites.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** There you have six potential taglines. We'll start with Carol. I'm going to go with the LLM one.

**Carol Lee:** It's like a really long one, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** We move to Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm going to go for a crawling URLs extension in Firefox, please. And I'll lock that in now. I'd like to lock in that answer. Do we have to lock in answers? Are we good?

**Jerod Santo:** Mat is locked in on the Firefox extension.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There have been changes before, so locking in is actually appreciated.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, can I change it there after if I've locked in?

**Carol Lee:** No, you've locked in. Move on.

**Jerod Santo:** Jerod here in the editing room. At this moment, Taylor's power cut out and he dropped offline. Thankfully, he scrambled and got reconnected using his phone... So we just skipped him and went on to Thomas. Taylor does make it back before the end of the round, but he missed some guesses, which explains why he just blindly picks the second one. Okay, hope that helps.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:14:11.26\] Okay. We move to Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yes. I believe that this is a monitoring solution for Firebase. I like that idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright.

**Thomas Eckert:** Well, I haven't locked it in yet... Why would you need to monitor Firebase if it's run by Google...?

**Jerod Santo:** Because maybe they stopped running it?

**Thomas Eckert:** They might just stop running it. It's just a check to see whether or not they're still running it.

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, if you really trust them. Like, is it down? \[unintelligible 01:14:44.29\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Um, I'll stick with it. I'll stick with it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Monitoring for Firebase websites goes to Thomas. We go to Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's not the Vim, but better one.

**Jerod Santo:** Vim, but better?

**Thomas Eckert:** Vim, but better?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, wasn't number one "Vim, but better"?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was my other option, I guess.

**Thomas Eckert:** Firewalls.

**Jerod Santo:** You were going to write that, maybe.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was going to write that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Firewalls was number one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Firewalls.

**Jerod Santo:** Getting through firewalls.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What did Carol say? Wherever Carol went, I'm going. I'm following you, Carol.

**Jerod Santo:** She went with the LLM.

**Carol Lee:** I went with the long one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Why do you like that one?

**Carol Lee:** Because I was like, we're not going to write like three sentences... But I bet the real person wrote three sentences. You know?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's good logic.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. It just seemed like a longer thing to write.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's good logic. It's not Vim, but better. I'm going to go with Carol.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Adam goes with Carol. You might need a new song that is not about piling on, it's about piggybacking. Taylor, it's your turn. What are you thinking for Firecrawl?

**Taylor Troesh:** The second one.

**Mat Ryer:** Good choice.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's gonna go with "Vim, but better."

**Jerod Santo:** Number two: full-text search capabilities built for Firebase. Taylor goes with that one. Alright, so we can start with... The Firefox extension. Mat thought maybe it was a Firefox extension for crawling URLs. That was Adam's tagline. One point for Adam.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's good.

**Mat Ryer:** Nice one, Adam.

**Jerod Santo:** Thomas wanted monitoring for Firebase websites, even though he knew there'd be no reason to have it if you have Google monitoring it... But he picked it anyways, and that was Taylor's, so one point for Taylor. And Taylor went for full-text search for Firebase. That one was Mat's. One point for Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Sorry...

**Thomas Eckert:** Mat, you and I had pretty similar submissions.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** I think we think more alike than you feel comfortable...

**Mat Ryer:** ...admitting \[unintelligible 01:16:40.23\]

**Carol Lee:** He knows it's you because he senses a piece of himself, maybe.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah... I mean, Carol said it, so it's got to be true.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** She has a PhD.

**Jerod Santo:** Meanwhile, Carol went for the long one, the LLM one. And Adam piggybacked, which is not exactly a pile-on, it's more of a piggyback... Which might need a song of its own. But they are correct.

**Carol Lee:** Yes...!

**Jerod Santo:** So that is the actual definition and the tagline for Firecrawl. "It turns your entire website into LLM-ready Markdown or structured data."

**Carol Lee:** It's so freaking long.

**Jerod Santo:** Carol gets two. Adam gets two, plus the one he already got, so he gets three for the round. Adam's in it to win it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How close am I to winning?

**Jerod Santo:** After round five...

**Adam Stacoviak:** 12 points?

**Jerod Santo:** You have eight. Mat has 10, Carol has 12, she's within striking distance... We're only halfway through the rounds.

Meanwhile, Thomas and Taylor tied in last, with four.

**Taylor Troesh:** Can I tell you guys about a cocktail I used to make?

**Mat Ryer:** What kind was it?

**Jerod Santo:** Do we get to pick, or...?

**Taylor Troesh:** It's two shots of Fireball and LaCroix. Pompomousse LaCroix.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you call it a Firecrawl?

**Carol Lee:** You should.

**Taylor Troesh:** Something like that, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Cool. Taylor's pining for bonus points, but he's not going to get a bonus point for that. We move now to round six. This is non-STEM, and it's also a bit nonsense... This word is a tough one. Round six. Your word is Quomo Docunquize.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:18:12.28\] Quomo Docunquize. That's one way to pronounce it. There are a few other pronunciations, but I won't try them.

**Taylor Troesh:** You've gotta spell that one in the chat. This word is spelled Quomo Docunquize. Quomo Docunquize. We'll find out if it's in an old book Carol read when she was a kid right after this. \[laughter\]

**Carol Lee:** It's a children's book, actually...

**Jerod Santo:** We've got a real stumper here. Everybody's faces look forlorn.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, the joy is gone from my thinking face.

**Carol Lee:** Aw...

**Thomas Eckert:** No, you know, I'm still a pretty easygoing guy...

**Carol Lee:** Thomas, it's okay. You don't need to defend that. I'm sorry.

**Thomas Eckert:** No, no, it's okay. It's not a performance. It is who I am.

**Jerod Santo:** Because he's tied for last...

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, it's because I'm tied for last. I used to be a champion...

**Jerod Santo:** You used to be a contender.

**Thomas Eckert:** I could have been a contender...!

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's a new doctor in town...! And she's gone beyond the masters, and he's gone all the way to doctorate.

**Jerod Santo:** That would be a good title for this one. "The doctor is in."

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. She has one-upped me, because I only have the masters. She has the doctorate.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. That's kind of why we invited her... We were sick of your \[unintelligible 01:19:27.12\] circumstance.

**Thomas Eckert:** What are you going to do next? What's beyond doctor? Two doctors?

**Taylor Troesh:** President.

**Thomas Eckert:** President? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we're probably gonna get the president elect.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Geez, man...

**Jerod Santo:** Quomo Docunquize. Now, that might be not how you say it. I don't know. It was really hard to get consensus on pronunciation.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, because no one needs this word. Well, we'll find out what it means, but --

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you need it right now, in order to win this game.

**Mat Ryer:** I do \[unintelligible 01:19:51.10\] to be fair. I've used it quite a lot so far today, actually, now that you mention it.

**Jerod Santo:** Be careful or we'll make you sing a song about it. None of us want that to happen.

**Mat Ryer:** I can't even pronounce it.

**Jerod Santo:** Carol is within striking distance... She only needs three points to win. I have Taylor's, and Carol's, and Thomas'es.

**Thomas Eckert:** Did Carol get it right?

**Jerod Santo:** I haven't read hers yet...

**Carol Lee:** If I did, it was by accident. Somehow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I accidentally used my master's degree today...

**Carol Lee:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just by accident, I was right again. Can't even get it wrong...!

**Thomas Eckert:** You try to get it wrong.

**Carol Lee:** Try, but sometimes you just \[unintelligible 01:20:34.00\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Pulled a Carol today. Got it right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Carol J. Always right.

**Thomas Eckert:** The J stands for right...

**Carol Lee:** The J stands for right... \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was kind of like a Trump sounding laugh. I felt like I was channeling somebody there... Carol J...

**Carol Lee:** It was, yeah. \[laughter\] Always right...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Always right, Carol J... People are saying...

**Carol Lee:** Everyone knows...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I wouldn't call her right...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we have six definitions for Quomo Docunquize. And they're all over the board, which makes sense, because you can't make much sense of this word.

**Adam Stacoviak:** If anybody got this right...

**Thomas Eckert:** Not even Carol.

**Jerod Santo:** Number one - a political theory of history wherein technology leads to changes in the status quo. Number two, to make money by any means possible. Number three, the Moon's last defense against humanity.

**Carol Lee:** That one.

**Jerod Santo:** Number four, the process of changing the features at rest of a movable object. Number five, when thrust reaches its maximum output, producing the greatest possible force to propel the vehicle. And number six, the process of documenting organizational procedures, quotas, and financial records for legal purposes. There you have six potential definitions for Quomo Docunquize. We start with Carol.

**Carol Lee:** Can you repeat the first three? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:22:11.21\] First three? That was a lot of work, you know? Okay.

**Carol Lee:** I know, I'm sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** It's okay.

**Carol Lee:** It's a long word, it's a lot of definitions... Come on.

**Jerod Santo:** It is. There's a lot. This is a lot, and there's a lot on the line here. I mean, you're trying to win this game right now. Okay.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. I feel like people really got wordy here. Alright, go.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Number one was the political theory of history wherein technology leads to changes in the status quo. Number two was to make money by any means possible. And number three was the Moon's last defense against humanity.

**Carol Lee:** Taylor wants me to choose three, so I'm just going to skip that one, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to hear the other three? \[laughter\]

**Carol Lee:** Actually...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, number four. The process of changing the features at rest of a movable object. Number five, when thrust reaches its maximum output, producing the greatest possible force to propel the vehicle. And number six, the process of documenting organizational procedures, quotas, and financial records for legal purposes. Quomo Docunquize.

**Carol Lee:** Saying the word again doesn't help.

**Jerod Santo:** I know... That's all I can do.

**Carol Lee:** I'm debating between two and five.

**Jerod Santo:** What's your thought process looking like?

**Carol Lee:** I don't even remember what -- I honestly don't know. I can't even remember what two was and what five was.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, two is the make money one, and five was the thrust one.

**Carol Lee:** I feel like it's not... I'm going to go with two. I don't know --

**Jerod Santo:** Carol votes...

**Carol Lee:** Oh, I don't know. Okay, we'll just go with it. It's fine.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you locking in?

**Carol Lee:** I know it's not one. It can't be one. Okay. It's two. I'm going to say two. We'll lock it in. \*bleep\* it. Sorry. Bleep it. Go.

**Jerod Santo:** She's saying bleep it, and she's going with two. Okay. We move now to Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Okay. I feel like this is -- it's not a STEM thing, so I actually think it's the documenting...

**Carol Lee:** Thank you for that validation.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. Yeah. I think it's documenting the process of an organization. That sounds right to me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. That's number six. Locked it in. We're going to Mat.

**Thomas Eckert:** Now, Mat, can you tell which one was mine? Because you said you could, by vibes alone.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I won't reveal it now. But yes, I think I know.

**Thomas Eckert:** Do you think you know?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. This is a tough one. Some of them are STEM, and he did say it wasn't a STEM one, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's more like a not-STEM.

**Mat Ryer:** I don't buy the -- I don't think I buy that... I think that legal one is -- I was thinking of coming up with some lie like that. So that's probably the one I think is -- did you just go for that one, Thomas?

**Thomas Eckert:** Yes, I did.

**Jerod Santo:** He did.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh.

**Jerod Santo:** And he locked it in, so you can't convince him otherwise.

**Mat Ryer:** No, it's locked in.

**Thomas Eckert:** But he wouldn't want to if he doesn't think it's the right answer.

**Mat Ryer:** The Moon one's obviously absolutely ridiculous. That person should probably be ashamed of themselves.

**Carol Lee:** Or extremely proud.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I think \[unintelligible 01:25:06.04\]

**Jerod Santo:** I think we're leaning more towards the pride side of that.

**Carol Lee:** \[unintelligible 01:25:11.02\]

**Mat Ryer:** Can I just pass? I don't know. Can you pass?

**Thomas Eckert:** Then you can't get any points.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, you just don't get any points.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh. I might as well pick one at random.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah, you might as well just pick one.

**Jerod Santo:** Come on, man. Play the game.

**Thomas Eckert:** You've nothing to lose.

**Mat Ryer:** I'll go for the money one then.

**Jerod Santo:** The money one?

**Thomas Eckert:** Alright.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Random.

**Jerod Santo:** Always go for the money, I guess, if you don't have anything else to do... Okay, Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** Moving thing. The moving vehicle.

**Jerod Santo:** The movable object?

**Taylor Troesh:** Moving object, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** The process of changing the features at rest of a movable object? Or the possible force to propel a vehicle? It's the movie.

**Taylor Troesh:** \[01:25:48.03\] That one's fake, dude. No, that one's fake.

**Carol Lee:** I feel like those two are Thomas and Mat. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Now we go to Adam. Last one, Adam...

**Adam Stacoviak:** My choice is not my choice, my choice is Carol's choice. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You're just a piggybacker.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Carol Lee:** You guys are going to feel really sad when I got it wrong...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, there's only two non-STEM ones there, right? And it was not STEM, so...

**Thomas Eckert:** But there's three non-STEM ones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** If I have to choose a route of limited abilities and choices, I'm going to go with the one that has 12 points.

**Jerod Santo:** That Carol picked.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Well, I think piggybacking is a good way to finish second or third, you know? But it's never a good way to beat somebody.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Because you're always going to just be where you are plus their points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** Anyways.

**Adam Stacoviak:** At least I'm coming up.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a strat, it's just not a good one. Okay. But it was a good one this round, because that is absolutely the right definition.

**Thomas Eckert:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** It is to make money by any means possible.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I fluked it, too.

**Carol Lee:** I knew it wasn't the sixth one, because that was mine. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, it was yours.

**Thomas Eckert:** It was really good!

**Carol Lee:** That's when I was like "Well, I know it's not that one, so... I don't know." \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Why have we not heard that word before? That seems like a word that --

**Carol Lee:** I think it's a stupid word...

**Jerod Santo:** Quomo Docunquize? Now, this is a Latin word from the 1600s. It's absolutely dead. No one uses it anymore. But that's what it used to mean.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's because you're mispronouncing it.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's entirely possible.

**Carol Lee:** How do you pronounce it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, back in those days, money was called keys, or quees. And it's actually Quomo Docunquize.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that changes everything.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's to acquire all the quees. I just made that up.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he did. He totally made that up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, man.

**Mat Ryer:** I've already put that in the long-term memory...

**Adam Stacoviak:** See? Doctorate stuff, bran science... BS.

**Jerod Santo:** You need to purge that.

**Thomas Eckert:** In the garbage collector.

**Jerod Santo:** So that means that Adam scores two, Mat scores two, Carol scores two, but then she also just confessed that hers was number six, which Thomas selected, so she scores three, and Taylor picked Mat's, and that scores three, because the movable object was Mat's. So both Mat and Carol score three.

So after six rounds of play, Mat has 13 points, which is right on the doorstep of our winner, Carol, who has 15 points, from noob to master. Congratulations.

**Carol Lee:** Moral of the story is remember the books you read as children, kids.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yes... I've gotta go back to childhood and read more.

**Jerod Santo:** Or time-travel back to childhood and read more.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Go to the store and buy books, not babies.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm going to buy loads of kid books just to catch up. I feel like I'm behind.

**Thomas Eckert:** Mm-hm. You can read them really fast.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's true. Although I struggle with some of the longer ones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They're pretty easy to read, yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** Quomo Docunquize...

**Carol Lee:** Like Quomo Docunquize...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, well, congratulations to our winner... And I think she got round one correct, round two pre-correct, round three pre-correct, round four, correct, round five, correct... Round six... She didn't miss a single one.

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm beginnings to think there's value to education here...

**Carol Lee:** Logic...

**Jerod Santo:** You've utterly dominated...

**Taylor Troesh:** Wait, how close am I to winning?

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor, you have four points.

**Carol Lee:** So close...!

**Taylor Troesh:** I can still come back, right?

**Carol Lee:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, if there's more games to play, perhaps.

**Taylor Troesh:** Next time...

**Jerod Santo:** Next time we'll just not invite Carol back, so that other people have a chance. Oh, that's what I said about Thomas last time, so...

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. And you said that about Taylor, too.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, that's what you said. But now we need to bring somebody in who could beat Carol. And --

**Jerod Santo:** Apparently, there's levels of skill at this, and we've just found someone at a whole new level.

**Taylor Troesh:** Wasn't I the one that invited Carol?

**Thomas Eckert:** Dude.

**Taylor Troesh:** That was a mistake.

**Jerod Santo:** What were you thinking?

**Taylor Troesh:** She didn't seem smart when I was talking to her... \[laughter\]

**Carol Lee:** I know. It's all an act, sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know, you proved it out here today... Now, we do have a couple more... Does anybody got a head? We've got a couple more rounds that I prepared. Maybe we could play them for the bonus people.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's do it. Bonus it out.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** \[01:29:46.11\] I don't go on call for another hour, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Maybe an extended winner, maybe... Is it possible to go beyond and beat Carol? Play to 20?

**Thomas Eckert:** Sudden death...

**Jerod Santo:** Play to 20. \[laughs\] Yeah. We're going to nullify her victory and see if anybody can beat her to 20.

**Carol Lee:** Rude...

**Jerod Santo:** No, let's just wipe the slate clean. Carol won the game. Now we're all back at zero, and we will just play a few more rounds and see what happens.

**Thomas Eckert:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Because I've put a lot of work into this round seven.

**Taylor Troesh:** Is this for Changelog Plus people?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Take your clothes off. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh... It's the wrong kind of Plus.

**Taylor Troesh:** I was trying to help him plug, you know...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is not normally Changelog. This is Changelog Plus Plus.

**Jerod Santo:** Should we plus-plus this?

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, yeah. Milk 'em. Get the money.

**Jerod Santo:** Milk 'em.

**Carol Lee:** Yeah. Plus-plus it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. For you regular listeners, the show's over. \[laughter\] We hope you enjoyed \#define...

**Taylor Troesh:** Carol wins... Sucks!

**Jerod Santo:** Mat only sang one song, but we've got to get him to sing some more during the Plus Plus portion. If you're not a Plus Plus member - well, let's fix that bug. Go to Changelog.com/++, sign up, make your own feed, no ads, Mat Ryer singing more songs...

**Mat Ryer:** Hello!

**Jerod Santo:** ...Taylor making a comeback and winning... I don't actually know what's going to happen, but it's going to be good. So there you go.

**Thomas Eckert:** Taylor, you didn't have to take your shirt off. Put it back on.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, I thought you said ads.

**Thomas Eckert:** Ads? Apps. Abs.

**Jerod Santo:** I said no ads. I wasn't referring to your abs.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, ads. I heard abs. I'm sorry.

**Mat Ryer:** Same thing for me, because I'm ripped. I sell ad space on my abs. So... Get in touch if you want.

**Jerod Santo:** It's actually not a bad idea. It's kind of like the million-dollar website, like there's each pixel. Each one of your little abs could be a dollar.

**Mat Ryer:** I loved that one as a kid.

**Jerod Santo:** You could buy an ab.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Six bucks.

**Jerod Santo:** Buy one of Mat Ryer's abs.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Well, just sponsor it. You're not buying it. You don't get it. You're sponsoring it. You're not getting it. You can't have it. I checked, we can't do that.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, if you're an organ donor...

**Mat Ryer:** I don't think they take abs. \[laughter\] I don't think that's what the card means... Like "This guy's ripped! Quick, let's get him!"

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, I mean, some of us could use a little help. Get on the list...

**Carol Lee:** Got an ab transplant, don't worry about it.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** This guy just died in a horrific accident. He's got great abs and a good back. Quick, get his strong back!

**Jerod Santo:** Get his strong back.

**Mat Ryer:** Just a rich 90-year-old. He's got an amazing back now...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, let's wrap this so we can start the next round.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Goodbye, friends.

**Mat Ryer:** Goodbye.

**Carol Lee:** Bye!
