**Jerod Santo:** Welcome to another awesome episode of \#define, our game of obscure jargon, fake definitions, and expert tomfoolery. Our contestants checked their imposter syndrome at the door, because they either know what these words mean, or they're going to fake it till they make their peers think they do. Adam, you've played this game a lot...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've lost every time, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you feeling like you're going to win today?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my...

**Jerod Santo:** Feeling good?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I'm not on video, so at least -- maybe in the clip, but my face is sad, because I have not won yet. But maybe today. Maybe.

**Jerod Santo:** You did have a nice accolade. I think our last time we played, one particular listener said your answers were always his favorite.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Well, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** So that's kind of a win.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You've got to win somewhere, right?

**Jamie Tanna:** That's as good as winning everything, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Put that on a dagger. Okay, so for this particular game we decided "Let's get some of our Changelog++ supporters, some of our diehard fans and our listeners to hop on the mic and play with us." So I put out a call and asked if anybody had a good setup, if they were free this afternoon... And I can't remember what else I said. Likes playing silly games...

And we got three respondents. They are all here today. One of them you may know, because he's been on the pod before... It's Jamie Tanna. Jamie, what's up, man?

**Jamie Tanna:** Hey, great to be back. Been a while...

**Jerod Santo:** Here you are. You're here now. Are you good at making up fake definitions for real words? We're going to find out... \[laughter\]

**Jamie Tanna:** I was going to say, that's perfectly real-time "No."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay... Audio listeners only out there - he was not sure what to say.

**Jerod Santo:** He's like "Gosh, do I go for it or not? Because I'm going to be found out here..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Should I boast, or what...?"

**Jerod Santo:** We're also joined by Spencer Lyon from Orlando. Welcome, Spencer.

**Spencer Lyon:** Thanks. Happy to be here. Hopefully -- I'm rooting to maybe extend Adam's losing streak, I don't know. We'll see if Jamie, David and I can make it happen.

**Jerod Santo:** I think the odds are in your favor.

**Spencer Lyon:** Three to one, if you're just playing blind.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. There's also the spread, because I do get to participate in kind of a strange way... But we should introduce E. David Aja. Welcome, David.

**E. David Aja:** Thank you. Happy to be here. First time, long time...

**Jerod Santo:** Happy to have you as well. So how this game works is we have 10 rounds, if we need them all, but we also have a goal of 15 points, which you can score in multiple ways. So I will provide for each round a word, with a couple of rounds that aren't quite standard... But a standard round is a word which comes from the broad-ranging world of STEM. I've been extending it beyond STEM. There's some music, there's some video games... There's anything you might imagine a nerd would love in the mix. And these words are obscure, and sometimes old and quite jargony... If you know the word's definition, you submit to me that. If you submit that correctly right away, you get three points, and you get to sit that round out, because you know the definition. If you don't know the definition, you make one up, you submit that, and then I gather them all together and I read them along with the actual definition, and you all take your turns trying to identify which one is the correct definition. For each person who guesses it correctly at that point, you get two points. And for each person you trick into selecting your definition, you get one point. If nobody after the end of the round actually lands on the correct definition, I, your humble moderator, get four points. First one to 15 points wins. Any questions?

**Spencer Lyon:** Let's rock.

**Jerod Santo:** I guess I just explained that so well, there's no questions. Okay, let's start then. Hopping right in to round one, where the word for round one is myoclonus. Myoclonus. That's M-Y-O-C-L-O-N-U-S. Please submit to me your definitions for the word myoclonus now.

**Spencer Lyon:** Do we get points for making Jerod laugh while reading? That's the question.

**Adam Stacoviak:** In here, yeah. He would give you a pat on the back.

**Spencer Lyon:** Get some cred. Some street cred.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No real official points, but \[unintelligible 00:07:31.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** You get docked points, by making my job harder.

**Jamie Tanna:** I was going to say, and then you also have to watch people's faces as they're being read out, to see if someone's like "Oh yeah, that was mine. That was a good one."

**Spencer Lyon:** That was funny.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There are some social cues, yeah, that you can look out for... Unless you're me, and I do nothing. I have a stone face here. There's no giveaways. This is poker to me.

**Jerod Santo:** "This is poker to me..."

**Jamie Tanna:** There definitely is a giveaway in one of the rounds, and I'm looking forward to taking advantage of that.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... I have Spencer's, David's and Jamie's, which means we're just waiting on Adam.

**Spencer Lyon:** Shocking.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:08:10.14\] Yeah, I know. Sorry. I don't know how to describe it... I'm working on it.

**Jerod Santo:** So one suggestion that we've had is to post all the definitions to you all, and then read them once. And that cuts down on the people asking to repeat. Now, I think the asking to repeat is kind of funny, but it does get old. That's kind of the funny part. My fear with -- the reason I haven't done it is because there's a certain amount of tells, even in the text, whether it's misspellings, or the way that I present things, that can sometimes lead to you knowing whether or not it's real. So I'm curious, as we are here in the first round, what you all think about that.

**E. David Aja:** I mean, if you had some kind of tokenizer that like stripped all the punctuation and things, that might be a way to quickly homogenize things a little bit... But the misspellings thing is probably harder to capture.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Spencer Lyon:** I kind of like the spontaneity... It's funny to hear, as a listener, people's reactions. Maybe it's not the best for game integrity, but maybe for entertainment value it's a good choice.

**Jerod Santo:** The reason why I would lean towards leaving it alone is because as a listener, you don't get the advantage of being able to look at the sentences... And so having them be repeated for you is actually helpful, because you're like "I don't remember what that one was either." And so there's a camaraderie to that, you know... But I fully admit that it's not efficient at all, because you're like "Can you say that one again?" and it gets to be like "Dude, I've said it six times, Adam. Come on, stop."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my name's in there?! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you might be the most requester of them all.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've played the most. I've played the most.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah, I think no definitions in the chat makes sense.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. It's been a few people that have said this, so not like a major complaint or anything. Alright, I have all five definitions for myoclonus. That's your four, as well as the correct definition. They are, number one, a term that defines the family of different forms of life that undergo mitosis. Number two, an eye disorder that results in double vision. Number three, a pre... \[laughter\] It's been a while since I've done this. Okay. Number three, a precursor to the monocle, an ancient Mayan seeing aid used to magnify small objects. Number four, known as a sibling of restless leg syndrome... \[laughs\] Sorry.

**E. David Aja:** Restless leg syndrome is serious.

**Jerod Santo:** I know it is. And I'm offending somebody... Known as the sibling of restless leg syndrome, is when your muscles twitch and have sudden movements. Number five, the brief involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles. There you have five definitions, read perfectly, each one...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hah...!

**E. David Aja:** \[unintelligible 00:11:11.21\]

**Spencer Lyon:** First try! First try!

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm warming up still; still warming up... And we are going to see if we can identify which one's real. We'll start with Jamie.

**Jamie Tanna:** What was the second one again?

**Jerod Santo:** The second one was an eye disorder that results in double vision.

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah, I'm going to go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Jamie takes double vision. We go now to David...

**E. David Aja:** Uh, the fifth one. The muscle one.

**Jerod Santo:** The muscle one. Okay, David takes the muscle one. We go to Spencer...

**Spencer Lyon:** I'm going to stick with David here. I'm thinking twitchy muscles, but not necessarily restricted to the legs.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. It goes beyond legs. Spencer takes number five, that's the muscle one. And now we go to Adam. Are you going to pile on? Are you going to spread it out? Are you going to --

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:12:03.10\] I don't know. I guess, I don't know what to do. I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, do you need me to repeat any of them for you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, that -- was it four or five that made you laugh? Which one made you laugh?

**Jerod Santo:** The sibling of restless leg syndrome. \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm kind of liking that one...

**Jerod Santo:** Not because it's unbelievable, just because I think it's --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'll pile on. I'll pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'll pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** So we have a pile on.

**Jamie Tanna:** That's early for a pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** Nobody thought it was the sibling of restless leg syndrome... Probably because I didn't read it very well. I apologize.

Adam, you had that one. That was yours. You also misspelled known, so I was trying to overcome that... I had to add the N in my head as I tried to read it, and so you really stumbled me right at the front... And then I thought, "Why does restless leg syndrome have a sibling?" \[laughter\]

**Jamie Tanna:** For the arms, or...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. They have like restless arm syndrome, or what...? So you just got me with that one, and you got nobody else, probably because of that. However, Spencer also didn't trick anybody with his precursor to the monocle. Nobody picked that one. That was Spencer's. And Jamie didn't get anyone, with "a term that defines the family of different forms of life that undergo mitosis." So it's not looking very good for me, because those are three fake ones. The other fake one that was selected was an eye disorder that results in double vision. Jamie guessed that. That was David's, so one point to David for the eye disorder. I thought that was a good one; double vision, mono...

**E. David Aja:** Mio for like myopic...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Spencer Lyon:** There you go...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, well played. However, once I read the actual definition, it seems like you guys knew what it was... "The brief involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles, that is myoclonus." So David, Spencer and Adam all get two points each. So after round one, David's in the lead with three, Spencer and Adam tied with two, and Jamie and I not quite yet on the board... But there's lots of \#define left to play.

We move now to round two, where your word for round two is eigengrau. That's E-I-G-E-N-G-R-A-U. Eigengrau. Submit to me your definitions just as soon as you have them. Is restless leg syndrome a thing?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes... I guess while we're here in the break - I thought I was on the money with that one, because I learned about that, because for a bit there I thought I had it... And that's when I learned about myoclonus, or however it's pronounced... It's twitchy stuff, so I thought I had on the money, but maybe I was off a little... Because that's how I learned about it. Because for a bit there I had this this thing where I thought I had -- like, I just had twitches for a bit. It was when my thigh was a little off. And it was kind of caused from that because there's a -- when you have like a thyroid issue, you can also have like versions of arthritis, but it's not like full on arthritis; it's kind of like arthritic things... And that's kind of a sibling to restless leg syndrome, because I thought I had that... So they described several things, and that was in my memory from that...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And that's why I described it that way.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it wasn't bad. I'd never heard of restless leg syndrome.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's pretty bad.

**Jerod Santo:** But yeah, it's just basically like your leg twitches uncontrollably, huh?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can't stop moving it, yeah. It's like, it just moves without you wanting it to. And it's usually during sleep, when you're trying to sleep. And so obviously, your sleep sucks. I can see how that reads funny, though... Especially since it says kno, versus known.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... That's what got me first. Then I started thinking "Sibling?" and it just got me giggling.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:15:38.26\] Somebody asked... Who was it that asked? Was it David? Was there extra points for making Jerod laugh?

**Spencer Lyon:** That was my question, but so far you're in the lead. You're in the lead.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I got him to laugh, round one.

**Spencer Lyon:** So you've got a fun speaker lined up for the weekend in Denver, and then other activities... What else is happening in the live show?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we're going to do our Kaizen episode with Gerhard, and we're going to be launching -- cutting over Pipely to go live, so that'll be interesting... That's basically it. It's a two-parter. So an interview and then a Kaizen.

**Spencer Lyon:** \[00:16:14.00\] That sounds great.

**Jerod Santo:** And whatever else we make up on stage. We have all the definitions for eigengrau. Number one, the dark gray color that people perceive in complete darkness, rather than seeing pure black. Number two, "When naming the beer Ziegenbock..." \[laughter\] Dude, you can't laugh while I'm -- I'm going to have to mute you. When naming the beer Ziegenbock - this name was also in the running - it describes a patent pending process for mixing beer, so they considered it for the name of the beer. Number three, the deeply primal feeling of fear, driven by a heightened increase of cortisol as if hearing the blood curdling cry of a beast while on the hunt.

**Adam Stacoviak:** These are amazing definitions.

**Jamie Tanna:** That's intense.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, these are good. The imaginary counterpart to the eigenspace of a matrix for complex valued matrices. And number five, from the German, for singularly gray. There you have five definitions of eigengrau. David, we start with you.

**E. David Aja:** Sorry, could you remind me of the first one?

**Jerod Santo:** Number one was a dark gray color that people perceive in complete darkness rather than seeing pure black.

**E. David Aja:** I mean, I think as appealing as Adam's beer definition is -- \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, you can't out him like that...

**E. David Aja:** I don't think I did... I'm going to go for the first one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, the first one. Spencer, what are you thinking?

**Spencer Lyon:** I'm thinking number five, the German word for singularly gray.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So far we've got gray and gray. Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've gotta say, those two definitions make me think something's in a shade of gray here, so I'm thinking number five as well, the German version of gray.

**Jerod Santo:** Piling on gray, the German gray. Jamie, are you going to pile on?

**Jamie Tanna:** I'm going to go for the other gray...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Okay, so if we're piling on gray... You're going to pile on the other gray.

**Jamie Tanna:** So I'll go for one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So number one, we have David and Jamie on one, and we have Spencer and Adam on five. Both definitions about gray. One of them is correct, one of them is incorrect, I'll tell you that much. And the definition that is incorrect is literally true though, from the German for singularly gray... So that's just knowing the compound word, I suppose, and not the definition.

The definition actually is the dark gray color that people perceive in complete darkness, rather than seeing pure black. So that one was the actual definition. And David and Jamie both picked that. So David gets two, Jamie gets two... However, David was so close because he also knew from the German for singularly gray - that was his, so he also tricked two people... And so he scores four.

**Spencer Lyon:** That's a big round.

**Jerod Santo:** Congrats, David. You must feel good about yourself...

**E. David Aja:** I do. I lived in Berlin for like half a year, and so in that time -- I'm just like, "Yeah, that's enough to--"

**Jerod Santo:** That's enough to put that word together, Eigen... Does eigen mean singular?

**E. David Aja:** That actually, I just kind of went with the mathy eigenvector value, or whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. According to Wikipedia, eigengrau is the German from intrinsic gray. And so maybe eigen means intrinsic. Also called eigenlicht. I can't speak German... Dark light, or brain gray. It's the uniform dark gray background color that many people report seeing in the absence of light. The term eigenlicht dates back to the 19th century, and has rarely been used in recent scientific publications. So there you go.

**E. David Aja:** \[00:20:09.03\] How would they all be reporting it as gray? Like, there's no -- I'm sorry, that's a philosophy question.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, they think they're seeing black, but they're not, basically... Because it's just like "Well, it's dark, so it's black." It's actually not black.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's the absence of light.

**Jerod Santo:** It's eigengrau.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's interesting. We have a cave here in Texas that you can go to as a tourist, and go to the pitch black part of it...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So they'll take you deep enough that you're not in danger... They'll turn the lights off, and it literally is pitch black, or what they call pitch black. And so maybe I should go back there and test this eigengrau.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Spencer Lyon:** Did you know this is actually eigengrau?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is not pitch black. I'll correct them. The tour guide.

**E. David Aja:** You'll just yell "Das ist eigengrau!" \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Das ist eigengrau!" And be really angry.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Alright. Well, you should be really angry, because you're getting whooped by David at this point... As is all of us, because he has seven points after two rounds.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** The rest of you all are tied with two. There's plenty of \#define left to play. I'm still in the eigengrau, with zero. Let's move now to round three, where your word for round three is klystron. That's K-L-Y-S-T-R-O-N. Please submit to me your definitions for the word klystron. So I was debating in my head whether I should just give David the three points for being correct, because he was so close... And I decided to let him play, because he wasn't exactly right... But man, you actually scored way more points because I let you play, than you would have if I'd just given you the three points.

**Spencer Lyon:** You came out on top.

**E. David Aja:** I'm not mad about it.

**Jerod Santo:** That definitely paid off for you, so... Good job. I do like the sound of that...

**Spencer Lyon:** It's a clickety clackety.

**Jerod Santo:** It sure is.

**E. David Aja:** It's really emphatic.

**Spencer Lyon:** I pressed Enter, and you all knew I pressed Enter.

**Jamie Tanna:** During COVID, my partner and I -- so we were living at her house, and we were sharing an office, which was.. So it's a two-bed Victorian house, and so the office bedroom that we were sharing was not very big... And we both had mechanical keyboards. And it was the sort of time that -- like, at lunch we'd talk a little bit about work, and I wouldn't even need to tell my partner what was going on that morning... Because she would know if I'd been arguing with people on Slack, because it was very, very clear in that small room.

**Jerod Santo:** You were just emphatically typing.

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** But how does she know? You could have just been like in the flow state, coding like a madman; just really going after it.

**Jamie Tanna:** I think she learned pretty quickly, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's different? \[laughs\]

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah. Yeah, many more pauses when you're coding, to like think of the next thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. When you're ranting, you're just raving.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Was she like "Who are you arguing with? Are you winning?"

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. There - five definitions for the word klystron. Number one, a device that converts the kinetic energy of an electron beam into radio frequency power. Number two, the process of moving swiftly through water. Number three, the nickname for a grouping of subatomic particles, including the gluon and muon. Number four, a lesser used term in scientific vernacular, to denote a grouping of potassium heavy entities. And number five, a subatomic particle with negative charge and spin. These are all believable to this layman over here... Let's see what y'all think, starting with Spencer.

**Spencer Lyon:** I'm going to have to hear those first two again, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** Sure thing. Number one, a device that converts the kinetic energy of an electron beam into radio frequency power. And number two, the process of moving swiftly through water.

**Spencer Lyon:** \[00:24:14.25\] Hm... I think I'm going to go -- there were two subatomic particles, so I'm drawn to one of those ones... And the question is which one? I think I'm going to go negative charge and spin. Number five.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number five, a subatomic particle with negative charge and spin. Locky in right there. Adam, to you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, five sounds pretty awesome, but...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] But...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** But --

**Jerod Santo:** Not quite awesome enough.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...I really feel like there's something to number two. But there's a lot of people talking about protons, and \[unintelligible 00:24:53.09\] and stuff like that, and the potassiums...

**Jerod Santo:** Right? Charges...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Can you read number four for me again? Just so I can have clear -- that one was similar to five. Close

**Jerod Santo:** It's a lesser used term in scientific vernacular to denote a grouping of potassium heavy entities.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's go with five.

**Jerod Santo:** Five. The one that Spencer went with.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** You're going to pile on with Spencer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's got the points, I'm following him.

**Spencer Lyon:** It's not been a winning strategy yet, but... Adam and I are sticking together. It's going to pay off.

**Jerod Santo:** I was gonna say, you're going to have the same score. Alright. Now to Jamie.

**Jamie Tanna:** I was hoping David would go first...

**Jerod Santo:** He went first last time.

**Jamie Tanna:** What was number three? That was the other subatomic particle one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the nickname for a grouping of subatomic particles, including the gluon and muon.

**Jamie Tanna:** I'm not sure about the water one, but as it came out, I was like "Hmm, I don't know..." But I also don't know any of these words, so...

**Jerod Santo:** I think it's clear that none of us know what this definition is... \[laughter\] So it's a guessing game at this point.
**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah. I think I'm going to, again, try and split the vote, and go for number three, the other subatomic particle.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So you're liking subatomic, but you're going to go for the other subatomic. Alright, David, you are last to guess this round.

**E. David Aja:** I almost -- it's like the subatomic particle thing seems so obvious that it feels like a trap.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Cue Admiral Ackbar.

**E. David Aja:** Whereas... I don't know if -- there's no klystron for water... It doesn't sound right. The potassium thing is like \[unintelligible 00:26:30.29\] No, that doesn't work either. I don't know. What was the first one?

**Jerod Santo:** That was the device that converts the kinetic energy of an electron beam into radio frequency power.

**E. David Aja:** The kinetic energy of an electron beam.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, I don't -- I'm going to go for the... \[laughter\] I mean, yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is that scenario when like you're sold something, and you just want the salesperson to sell it to you... Can you just tell him which one to pick, Jerod?

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. You know, all I have is money \[unintelligible 00:27:04.21\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Just tell me what I should buy."

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. I'm going to go for the water one, just because I got --

**Jerod Santo:** The water one?

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, I don't know... I don't feel strongly about it, but... Yeah, that's what we're doing.

**Jerod Santo:** But if you had to pick one, you're going to pick the water one. The process of moving swiftly through water. Adam did say there was something to that one... There's something special about that one. Wasn't there, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Pretty special... \[laughter\] Tell him what he won.

**Jerod Santo:** He won one point for Adam.

**E. David Aja:** There you go.

**Jerod Santo:** Because there was something special about that one. For a second there, Adam, I thought you were going to do the "People are talking about" thing...

**E. David Aja:** "Everybody said..." This boat, it moves through the water with the klystron, you don't even know.

**Jerod Santo:** Right? People are talking about that water one. It's like, no, you're the first person to go. No one's talking -- okay. So yeah, Adam gets a point there. The pile on was to the subatomic particle with negative charge and spin - two points, because Spencer and Adam both selected that one... It goes back to David. So he's still scoring.

**E. David Aja:** That's why I didn't believe it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:28:09.23\] It was cool, I liked it.

**Jerod Santo:** It was a good one. I liked the gluon and muon the most. Jamie liked that one as well... And that was Spencer's. So the subatomic particles was too good to be true. Neither of those was the right answer...

**Spencer Lyon:** Oh... Is Jerod on the board now?

**Jerod Santo:** ...which means I score four points, because a klystron is a device that converts the kinetic energy of an electron beam into radio frequency power. Often called a klystron tube, if you're going to look up the actual thing... And - there you go. Surprised you guys didn't know that. I didn't know that either, but I knew it before you guys did, because I looked it up this morning.

**Spencer Lyon:** \[unintelligible 00:28:50.18\] 1937. It's been around.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's been out there. There's lots of YouTube videos. I watched them, because I wanted to figure out how to pronounce it. And I'm not sure if I pronounced it right, because I did see both klystron and klystron.

**E. David Aja:** Is it related at all to vacuum tubes, or is that just like a completely separate technology? No, it's not. I don't know. Yeah, never mind.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a tube, I don't know. I'm not a physicist.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was attracted to that one, too. I almost picked that one. It was close.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, people were talking about that water one... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's something to it.

**Jerod Santo:** There's something about it. There's something about that water one. Alright, so we've all scored now, we're all feeling good... Jamie didn't score that round, but you are on the board. So after three rounds, David's still in the lead with nine. I guess I move into second place with four... Wow. This is the closest I've ever been to winning. Adam and Spencer - tied, of course, because they select the same one every time, with three... And Jamie win two. So David's still out to a resounding lead, but I think we can catch him.

We're moving now to round four. This is a special round. We call it "Give it a goog." Give it a goog!

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ah, give it a goog...

**Break**: \[00:30:00.13\]

**Jerod Santo:** I went out to google.com in an incognito browser... I did not use a VPN, so yes, you can probably triangulate some stuff, because I was too lazy, even though I knew that might happen... And I googled "How does." Just those two words, "How does", and then I hit Space, to make sure it knows that does is over... And I stopped, and Google suggested some autocompletes. I have jotted down the number one autocomplete, and your job in this round is either to guess what Google autocompleted for me, or of course, come up with what you think it might autocomplete for most humans around the world. Please submit to me your autocompletes now.

**E. David Aja:** And this is -- you've googled this today?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Jamie Tanna:** And to confirm, you're in Omaha, Nebraska?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. Well, you can stereotype me, and then you can guess some stuff. \[laughter\] Feel free. It's fine.

**E. David Aja:** I was gonna say, yup.

**Jerod Santo:** You have all of your false ideas about what we're like...

**Spencer Lyon:** How does corn grow...?

**Jerod Santo:** No - see, we already know that. We're not going to be asking Google that. You have to think of what we're ignorant of. Adam, are you thinking, or what are you doing over there?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, because it looks like you're just staring at the camera, just like deeply breathing...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well -- oh, sorry. Am I breathing deeply? Maybe I'm excited. Oh, man. I think I'm excited. Now I'm self-conscious about my breathing. Who wants a little TMI? Do you want some TMI? \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** That's not normally how that works... \[laughter\]

**Spencer Lyon:** I don't know how to answer that...

**Jerod Santo:** I know exactly how to answer that. No. The answer is no. \[laughter\] But I'm going to hear it anyways, I'm sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I will not tell. I'm keeping it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Wow, it worked.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It worked.

**Jamie Tanna:** Can it be like a Plus Plus special?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Just bleep it for the regular people, and we'll unbleep it for Plus Plusers. I mean, this is a Plus Plus special right here. Okay... \[Changelog Plus Plus. It's better!\] Well, we gave it a goog and we tried to guess how people were googling "How does" stuff. That's not even a good sentence. I'm going to roll with it... And here's what we came up with. Five potential autocompletes for "how does". Number one, how does a bill become a law? Number two, how does farming work? Number three, how does astronomer make money? Number four, how does Ozempic work? And number five, how does the world end? How does the world end?

**E. David Aja:** Five... Four...

**Jamie Tanna:** We just took a dark turn there.

**Jerod Santo:** Like a dramatic countdown...? Alright, Adam, you are first this round, my friend.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh, man, there's like two in there that were really good.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, which ones were they?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I really have to ask you to read four of them again. Or three of them.

**Jerod Santo:** These are the shortest ones ever. How do you not remember them? Okay, I'll read them -- do you want them all?

**Adam Stacoviak:** The middle three were the ones that stood out most to me. So like two, three and four. Can you read those, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Two, three and four. Okay. Number two is how does farming work?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, that was not the one.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:35:59.25\] Number three, how does astronomer make money?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number four, how does Ozempic work?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, listen, I think it's number four, but I'm going to give it to number three, because damn, that's a good answer. \[laugher\] That is spot on. Whoever's that is if it's not real, they're awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Forever friend.
**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Adam goes with number --

**Spencer Lyon:** Date of recording might be relevant for that particular answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Astronomer, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Inquiring minds want to know, "how does astronomer make money?" Okay. Next up, it's going to be Jamie.

**Jamie Tanna:** So I was going to say, we've heard the middle three...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** How about number one and five...?

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah, one of them was how does a bill become --

**Jerod Santo:** How does a bill become a law?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was the first one.

**Jamie Tanna:** And then what was the other one?

**Jerod Santo:** And the last one was how does the world end? So there's your five. So you've got farming -- well, in order... You've got a bill, you've got farming, then you've got astronomer, then you have Ozempic, then you have the world.

**Jamie Tanna:** I think Ozempic. I mean, astronomer is like written perfectly how someone would search for it... But yeah, I think Ozempic.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Jamie picks Ozempic. David, do you?

**E. David Aja:** I'm going to go with Ozempic. I think that -- yeah, that seems right.

**Jerod Santo:** What are you guys trying to say? \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** It's very popular. People want to know how it works.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's true.

**Jerod Santo:** That's fair. Okay. Spencer?

**Spencer Lyon:** I'm torn... I feel like Adam and I have hitched our wagons together, and I've got to give props to astronomer. I mean, the reason I'm a Plus Plus subscriber - I like to support things that bring me happiness, and I like it, and that answer brought me a bit of happiness... So I'm going to go for astronomer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There you go.

**Jerod Santo:** Well played. Okay. So Spencer and Adam, hitched again, and...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ride or die, brother.

**Spencer Lyon:** Right to the bottom.

**Jerod Santo:** Some people want to know how astronomer makes money. I want to know how David makes money, because he is scoring left and right. That was his. Good job, David! And there's a funny backstory on that one, because without the capitalized A, I thought he was trying to say, "How do astronomers make money?" Also I'm curious, how do they? And I'm like "Do you want me to pluralize for that?" And he's like "No, man." I was like "Oh, I get it." I didn't get it at first.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, man.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I was like "Astronomers. Yeah, how do they make money? I don't know." So two points for him. And then "How does farming work?" Well, Jamie already made a joke about that, so that was his... How does a bill become a law? Nobody cares, Spencer. I mean, come on. Nobody wants to know.

**Spencer Lyon:** I mean, you had to have seen the video when you were in grade school, no?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, for sure.

**Spencer Lyon:** "How does a bill become a law?"

**Jerod Santo:** For sure.

**E. David Aja:** Not my favorite schoolhouse rock, though, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** That is a good one.

**E. David Aja:** Conjunction Junction.

**Jerod Santo:** Conjunction Junction.

**E. David Aja:** There it is.

**Jerod Santo:** What's your function? Hooking up words and --

**E. David Aja:** Phrases and clauses.

**Jerod Santo:** Phrases and clauses.

**Spencer Lyon:** Yes...!

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Meanwhile, Adam, the world ending one - didn't you do that similar last time around, something about the end of the world?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know what else to say, okay? I have a limited vocabulary...

**Jerod Santo:** He's got one thing on his mind... \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** Does Adam have a doomsday device somewhere? Should we be worried?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, I just don't have a good brain like you, David, because that was an awesome answer... And I guess I'm just bland. I could be more sparkling, I'm just a little bland, unfortunately.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, the correct autocomplete, or at least for my incognito tab on this side of the Earth, is "How does Ozempic work?" And Jamie and David both picked that, so two points each. That's two for Jamie in the round, four for David in the round. Other autocompletes that didn't quite make it as high, but were still on the list... Number two was "How does a HELOC work?" A HELOC. That is confusing. A home equity line of credit. A very complicated, but sometimes useful investing vehicle. "How does Plan B work?" "How does Zelle work?" You know, that thing where you can send money between banks... I don't know. I don't know how it works. And how does hail form? That's straight out of Nebraska right there, because we get hailed on so much.
**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:40:15.29\] And Texas, bro. Oh my gosh, yeah.

**Spencer Lyon:** I got a particularly Orlando response in my how does... So number one, also Ozempic.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Spencer Lyon:** Number two, "How does Lightning Lane work?" The Disney World FastPass system. No one knows.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh... No one knows. \[laughs\]

**Spencer Lyon:** They keep changing it.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like magic. It's dark magic.

**Spencer Lyon:** It's like magic you pay for, and then you don't know what happens.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... It's magic for them. Hilarious. Alright. Well, after just four rounds, we have like a world record pace here. David with 13 points. He's in striking distance of a win after four rounds. Wonder why I created 10 rounds... And tied for second is me and Jamie, with four. That's how far back we are. And tied in last is these two hitched together with three, Spencer and Adam.

**Jamie Tanna:** Can we go for a rule change and just like pool our points together? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Just team up on him? I make the rules... So I can make up whatever I wanted to, technically. I mean, it's our podcast, but... He might not come back, and maybe that's what we want. I don't know.

**E. David Aja:** \[unintelligible 00:41:20.13\]

**Jerod Santo:** We move now to round five... This is a new style round, even newer than the Google style round. This is called "Weird Flicks, But Okay..." I've scoured the internet for one of the oldest, most obscure, weird movies, and I've grabbed the title, the year it was released, and the synopsis. A brief one-sentence synopsis of what the movie is about. Your job is to write your own brief one-sentence synopsis and try to trick your friends into thinking yours is real. And of course, I guess if you know the actual movie and you tell me what it's about, you'll still get your three points.

I think if I were you guys, I'd start teaming up against David... Just saying. Just saying.

**E. David Aja:** So just like like the oldest possible movie is what we're going for?

**Jerod Santo:** They're pretty old. So this first one -- I have two of these rounds. The first one - this is a 1945. So it's an old movie. And the title of the movie is The Reckless Moment. The Reckless Moment. And your job is to come up with, or to know by having seen it, the synopsis of what that movie is about. So there you go. The Reckless Moment, from 1945.

**Jamie Tanna:** And to confirm, is this the official one-line synopsis?

**Jerod Santo:** This would be the one liner that is on the IMDb page. So it's not like a tagline. It's a synopsis. But IMDb people wrote it, not the movie creators, I don't think.

**Spencer Lyon:** What does Adam have in his -- what's he watching behind this...

**Jerod Santo:** Silicon Valley.

**Jamie Tanna:** Silicon Valley...!

**Spencer Lyon:** Is it always on? Always?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, whenever we're recording. I think he might turn it off in between, but... It's just loops, different scenes. Yeah, he's just trolling.

**Jamie Tanna:** I was trying to work it out from earlier, I thought it was Community... \[unintelligible 00:43:11.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** I thought it would be cool if he would do some different things, different episodes. Like, it could be Star Wars, it could be Silicon Valley, it could be Predator, you know... And he's just like "Nah. Only Silicon Valley, all the time."

**Adam Stacoviak:** You want me to change the show for you? "Yeah, I want to watch something different."

**Jerod Santo:** No, we were very excited when you left, because we could actually catch up on an episode we missed.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah...

**E. David Aja:** That doesn't generate like a copyright problem from HBO? They're not like \[unintelligible 00:43:40.25\]

**Jerod Santo:** No, it's obscure enough. Yeah, it's in the background enough we don't ever get a takedown request, thankfully.

**Jamie Tanna:** Do I remember we talked about there maybe being like a Changelog watch-along of Silicon Valley? Do like an episode a week?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that'd be cool. I never executed on that, because I didn't want to re-watch it, I guess... Or be forced to.

**Jerod Santo:** We also almost did a... So the last time we played this game -- what was that? He Who Gets Slapped? Was that the name of the movie, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes, yes.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:44:09.13\] We actually were going to watch that in Denver, as like a group activity, because it'd be hilarious... But the joke is funnier than the reality, so we're not going to do it. Because it's public domain. John Henry found out it's in the public domain, because it's like 1928. And so like "Man, we could like put it on a projector and watch it outside", or something. But... Too lazy.

**Spencer Lyon:** I see David's guitar's in the back. He may even need to start thinking of a victory jingle you can play for us. We're closing in.

**Jerod Santo:** Can you improv? Musically?

**E. David Aja:** Not well, no.

**Jerod Santo:** Not well. But you're definitely closing in on a win here.

**E. David Aja:** The hubris of asking... Has anyone ever won in five? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You know, there's a reason it feels hubris. Not that I can imagine, or remember... I can imagine it, I can't remember it.

This is our sixth time playing, isn't it? I think this is round six, and I think there may have been a win in five, but that was back when we played less points. I think we were going to 12 for a while, and we extended it to 15. So you would have already won in four, 12. Now, I think you're definitely on pace for the fastest W of all time. Or the greatest collapse in history...

**E. David Aja:** Or the greatest stroke. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's true.

**Jerod Santo:** The greatest collapse in the history of \#define. Alright, we now have everybody's entry for a plot synopsis of 1945's The Reckless Moment. Are you guys ready to hear what everybody had to say? Alright. Number one, "Well-to-do Howard Douglas makes a careless decision to leave his bowler hat at home." Number two, "The untold, untrue story of what Emperor Hirohito really told President Truman upon the Japanese surrender in World War II." Number three, "The harrowing story of how the invasion at Normandy almost had to be called off." Number four, "After discovering the dead body of her teenage daughter's lover, a housewife takes desperate measures to protect her family from scandal." Number five, "With the keys to his new Plymouth, Ben takes a drive to the lookout with his friends, where he met Betty." Hold on, I've read it wrong... "Where he met Betty, this knockout that sits next to his wife." \[laughter\]
**Adam Stacoviak:** How is this funny, Jerod?

**E. David Aja:** Try reading it in a transatlantic accent. That might flow a little bit more naturally...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. If I could. "Ben takes a drive to the lookout with his friends, where he met Betty, this knockout that sits next to him in chem class. They hit it off well, but when this mysterious woman shows up, everything changes."

**Jamie Tanna:** Was that all one sentence?

**Jerod Santo:** No, there's one break in there. After chem class there was a period. Okay. Five potential synopses for The Reckless Moment, starting with Jamie. Which one do you think is real?

**Jamie Tanna:** So I'm wondering... Emperor Hirohito and Normandy sound like they may be of the time period, but also could be quite near to already get a film out about Normandy. So I'm not sure. The very long one sentence makes me wonder if it's either not real, or is maybe --

**Jerod Santo:** Or real.

**Jamie Tanna:** The other two - I'm not sure - sound... Yeah, I think a little bit too far-fetched.

**Jerod Santo:** Which ones are far-fetched?

**Jamie Tanna:** The one about the bowler hat, and the housewife scandal. The bowler hat one just sounds a little bit out there. And the housewife scandal sounds like it could be more contemporary.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Jamie Tanna:** I can't imagine that sort of thing happening...

**Jerod Santo:** In the '40s.

**Spencer Lyon:** So you've eliminated all five.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I think that's all five. \[laughter\] One of which you wrote.

**Jamie Tanna:** \[00:48:11.02\] But which one...? Yeah, I don't know.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's his strategy.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm not going to say. He's just trying to make sure he doesn't pick David's.

**Jamie Tanna:** I'm just casting doubt widely.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. So having said all that, what are you going to do? I think I'm going to go for Normandy.

**Jerod Santo:** Normandy.

**Jamie Tanna:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. That's number three, by the way. Jamie goes for Normandy. David.

**E. David Aja:** You said the movie came out in '45... I think -- sorry, what was... So it was the bowler hat...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Number two was President Truman...

**E. David Aja:** Sorry, President Truman did what?

**Jerod Santo:** "The untold, untrue story of what Emperor Hirohito really told President Truman upon the Japanese surrender in World War II."

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's untrue and untold.

**Jerod Santo:** It's untold and untrue.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Now it's told, though.

**E. David Aja:** In '45...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**E. David Aja:** Alright. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** And then number three is the Normandy, which Jamie just picked.

**E. David Aja:** This is my way of backing into asking you to repeat all of them, so thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** And number four - do you want the full sentences or just the summaries? My summary of the summary?

**E. David Aja:** The full sentence, if you don't mind.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, we're doing it. Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** All of them?

**E. David Aja:** No, just the last two. Sorry, the last two.

**Jerod Santo:** The last two. Okay, number four was "After discovering the dead body of her teenage daughter's lover, a housewife takes desperate measures to protect her family from scandal." And number five is "With the keys to his new Plymouth, Ben takes a drive to the lookout with his friends where he met Betty, this knockout that sits next to him in chem class.

They hit it off well, but when this mysterious woman shows up, everything changes."

**E. David Aja:** Okay, I think I'm going bowler hat.

**Jerod Santo:** He's going bowler hat. Okay. Spencer.

**Spencer Lyon:** Adam, it's up to you, but I'm switching... I'm going with David. Bowler hat. Bowler hat it is.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] He's going with the bowler hat.

**Spencer Lyon:** No, I'm going with David. Let me clarify, I'm going with David. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Are you apologizing? What's happening here? Are we breaking up?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he switched off Adam and onto David, is what he's saying here.

**Spencer Lyon:** Well, no, it's Adam's choice. He can choose to follow me on David's bandwagon or not. But that's up to Adam.

**Jerod Santo:** I gotcha. So it's up to you if you want to pile on...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, David wouldn't choose his own, so... But he only needs two points to win.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And if he gets the right one, he gets one, right?

**Jerod Santo:** If he gets it correct, he gets two. If he tricks you, he gets one more.

**Adam Stacoviak:** David could be choosing his own, you know that, right?

**Jerod Santo:** He could be presupposing a pile on.

**Spencer Lyon:** Both of us are suckers to follow him for those two points, but maybe we are. We're in the back. I don't know.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's also going first though, so he's kind of creating the current to follow... He's creating the pile on, and you fought for his trick.

**Jerod Santo:** Jamie did go first, technically, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, sorry. Jamie went first.

**Jerod Santo:** But David would want you to know that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** David went first-ish...

**E. David Aja:** \[unintelligible 00:50:52.24\]

**Spencer Lyon:** If I fall into this trap that David laid, he's playing checkers and we're playing chess here. So he can win.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, man...

**E. David Aja:** The other way around.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I think he'd be playing chess.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's why we're going to lose right there.

**E. David Aja:** Exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly. \[laughter\] That's how confused he has Spencer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know, Jerod, I feel like that last one needs one more read. What do you think?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Jamie Tanna:** You're just trying to make sure we use the full two hours.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. "With the keys to his new Plymouth, Ben takes a drive to the lookout with his friends, where he meets Betty, this absolute knockout that sits next to him in chem class."

**E. David Aja:** Was absolute there before?

**Jerod Santo:** No, I just figured it needed to be there. "They hit it off well, but when this mysterious woman shows up, everything changes."

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm going with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Alright. So Adam picks his own. We'll just stop right there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm safe. I'm giving no points away.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. David and Spencer - or I should say Spencer piled on with David onto the bowler hat. That was Jamie's bowler hat.

**E. David Aja:** \[00:52:02.28\] Damn it... I was like "The guy from England is not going to do a bowler hat \[unintelligible 00:52:04.23\]

**Jerod Santo:** I thought it was kind of on the nose, but...

**E. David Aja:** Alright, yeah. He got me.

**Jerod Santo:** He sure did. And then he acted like it couldn't possibly be right, which made you want to pick it as well.

**E. David Aja:** Yup, yup.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's a good actor.

**Jerod Santo:** He is. And then Jamie went with the harrowing story of Normandy, and that was David's, giving David one point, but not a victory. He approaches the precipice. Meanwhile, Jerod scores four points... Thank you very much, everybody... Because the correct synopsis of The Reckless Moment is "After discovering the dead body of her teenage daughter's lover, a housewife takes desperate measures to protect her family from scandal."

**E. David Aja:** That sounded really spicy for '45.

**Spencer Lyon:** 1945... That's what I was thinking.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well --

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's why I didn't go with it.

**Jamie Tanna:** 1949.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, did I do it wrong? 1949. I'm sorry. That might have ruined some World War II ones. Did I mess with World War II? I must have wrote that down wrong.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I wrote down 1945 as well. What did I write down? Let me see what I wrote down here... Uh -- yeah, '45.

**Jerod Santo:** Ah. My bad, y'all. I award everybody except for David one point for my mistake. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Which is exactly why I made up a story about a car named Plymouth... Because the Plymouth came out in '41-'42.

**Jerod Santo:** So with bonuses applied, he still has more than twice as much as anybody who's actually playing. David has 14 points. I have eight, still not really playing... Jamie has seven. Adam and Spencer, even though Spencer broke off that hitch, they're still tied, with four points each.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ah... It's fun here at the bottom. \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** Ride or die.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Alright. We move to round six. We get to play around six. I wasn't sure if there would be one. And this is back to a pretty normal round. It's another word. However, this word's an acronym, so it's slightly different, because it's not just any old word. It's an acronym. So you have to come up with what the acronym stands for, and then that thing described or defined. So the acronym is WIMP. W-I-M-P. That's the acronym. So you'll come up with what it stands for, and then a definition of it.

Alright, so I looked it up... I remember Carol Lee, PhD, being quite dominant at this game as well. And it turns out she won after six rounds.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You missed it.

**Spencer Lyon:** Pressure's on.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, this is round six right here.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** So he could tie. He had a chance -- and I had to go back and listen to the transcript, or read the transcript, and see if that went to 12 points or 15. Oh yeah, it's 15 points, so it's apples to apples. I have Jamie's and David's definitions, which leaves us with one person. One heavy breather. Are you trying to intimidate us?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just giving good audio for the edit.

**Jerod Santo:** Or are you trying to give us a mid-90s R&B.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Loop that, Jason. Loop that.

**E. David Aja:** Either pull out a lightsaber, or...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Of course. Or seduce us. What are you thinking, like Tony Braxton, or...?

**E. David Aja:** The specific thing that was playing when I said that was Wait a Minute by Ray J, which is very -- in the chorus there's a lot of... But also, some of some the stuff by 112, I think, features that.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah. Room 112, where the players dwell. I remember them. Or at least I remember --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm zero informed by that.

**Jerod Santo:** ...Biggie Smalls rapping about that. I'm not sure if I remember them specifically. Okay, everybody's in. Five -- what do you call them? What do you call the fulfillment of an acronym?

**E. David Aja:** Expansion?

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:56:04.24\] Five acronym expansions, thank you... With definitions for the acronym WIMP. WIMP. Number one. WIMP. Worker Initialized Multiprocessing, a distributed computing execution strategy. Number two, Weekly Interacting Massive Particle - a hypothetical particle proposed as a candidate for dark matter. Number three. Wrought Iron Manifold Plateau - the culmination of the process for creating low-carbon iron alloys in which the maximum efficacy of the process is achieved. Number four. Windows Internet Management Platform - the Windows Internet Management Platform is a suite of tools used to manage the network's internet access at the enterprise level. And number five, Windows Image Management Package - the closed source proprietary answer to the popular open source image manipulation library GIMP. So it's like GIMP, but for Windows, if I had to put it in my own words.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Don't you smile like that, David... No, sir. No, sir. Okay, audio listeners, you didn't see that smile, okay? I saw that smile... That smile was "That's mine."

**E. David Aja:** "Stay away..."

**Jamie Tanna:** I'm sure David was thinking, "But the GNU Image Management Program is cross-platform."

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I'm sure he was thinking that.

**E. David Aja:** I hate that you are correct that that is what I was thinking. \[laughter\] I have definitely \[unintelligible 00:57:37.04\]

**Jerod Santo:** Didn't we interview the guy who built GIMP one time, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** We sure did. He also made CockroachDB.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that's right. What a talented fella.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. He talked a lot about GIMP too, because I didn't have a clue until I re-interviewed him.

**Jerod Santo:** You didn't have a clue of what GIMP was?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I think I did up until like the day before. Like, in my research I didn't know until then. It was a surprise to me. So like the plan for the call... And then the call was different because of it.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, here we go... This is not GIMP, this is WIMP, okay? Five definitions of WIMP. I've read them all, and I won't read them again, unless you ask me to. And David gets to go first. So David, you're right here, man. The game is in your hands. All you have to do is identify the actual WIMP.

**E. David Aja:** So there's GIMP for Windows... Yeah, I'm going to ask you to repeat. You don't have to go to the definitions, just the things spelled out.

**Jerod Santo:** The summaries. I will summarize. So number one is the worker initialized multiprocessing. That's a distributed computing execution strategy. Number two is the weekly interactive massive particle, a hypothetical particle for dark matter. Number three was wrought iron manifold plateau. And number four was the Windows internet management platform, whereas number five was the Windows image management package. That's your WIMP. Five WIMPs.

**E. David Aja:** Wrought iron manifold plateau... I wish I knew more about ironworking. I think I'm going to go for two, so weekly interacting massive particle.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. David goes for number two. And now we move to Spencer.

**Spencer Lyon:** That also is going to be my choice. I know what it looks, guys...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Spencer Lyon:** I had it circled on my notepad. I was going to go for number two.

**Jerod Santo:** That just says David's name. You just circled David's name. \[laughter\] Alright...

**Spencer Lyon:** But it does make me feel better about my choice, knowing that David had already picked it. So thank you, David.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair. There you go. Alright, Jamie, did you write anything down?

**Jamie Tanna:** I mean, much as number five is like really selling it to me, I think I'm going to go for the multiprocessing. The worker initiated multiprocessing.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number one.

**Jamie Tanna:** Just to go with something different.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, there you go. And Adam...

**Adam Stacoviak:** On my virtual notebook here I have also circled number two as a very plausible answer...

**Jamie Tanna:** \[01:00:25.06\] Independently...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Is that what you chose, Spencer?

**Jerod Santo:** That's what David chose.

**Spencer Lyon:** It's what I chose. Or, more importantly, it's what David chose, yes.

**E. David Aja:** Getting the band back together...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you might as well pile on. I mean, if you guys are all wrong, I do win, though. Oh, no, I don't. I only have 12.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm feeling like number four. I'm feeling number four is good. What's that one, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** Windows Internet Management Platform.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. That's it.

**Jamie Tanna:** It's missing \[unintelligible 01:00:53.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** You're not going to guess that one, are you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Of course. It's a safe play. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know, I don't understand you sometimes... Alright, Adam picked his own again. So he gets zero points for picking his own.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm too scared of David. He's going to win. I don't want to, though. I don't want to pick that one. It's a cop out. I should have more fun. We'll go with number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Which one are you doing?

**Adam Stacoviak:** We'll go with number two. Yeah, let's have more fun. Whoever earned that answer gets it, whatever it is.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair. It's a pile on. That's the best answer. Dark matter. Come on, dark matter...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, David, Spencer, and Adam all piled on. They followed David to the Weekly Interacting Massive Particles.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's so excited. Look at David.

**Spencer Lyon:** He's pumped.

**Jerod Santo:** He knows... And that is the correct definition for WIMP. It's a Weekly Interacting Massive Particle. So David scores two, Spencer gets two, Adam gets two... Jamie picked Worker Initialized Multiprocessing. That's David's. Ugh, this guy... He just can't do wrong. He can't do wrong. \[laughter\] So above and beyond, he gets three points. Didn't even need that many...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** And he wins, with 17 points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** Congrats, David.

**E. David Aja:** Thank you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So good.

**Jerod Santo:** Tied for the fastest win in \#define history. Perhaps the largest margin of victory, when second place was me, with eight. I'm not even playing, guys... Actual second place was Jamie, with seven, a full 10 points behind David. And then Spencer and Adam with six.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And one of those points was \[unintelligible 01:02:44.12\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. So David, as is our new tradition that I'm just making up right now, you must improvise us a song. No, I'm just kidding...

**E. David Aja:** Oh, hell no. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I just mistook you for Mat Ryer for a moment there... No, we will not have you to do that. However, you can say anything you like, you could promote anything you like... You have a moment to just say whatever you want, man. Go for it.

**E. David Aja:** Sure. I guess I'll plug some stuff from the open source stuff from the company I work for. So the company I work for is Posit.co. We make software for data scientists and scientific computing. A couple of things that might be interesting to check out - there's a project called Quarto, which is a sort of literate programming environment that lets you render R and Python code into websites, all kinds of documents... And we are also building an editor for data scientists called Positron. So check that out at Positron.Posit.co.

**Jerod Santo:** Very cool. We will link up all those things. Posit.co, Quarto.org, and Positron.Posit.co?

**E. David Aja:** Posiron.posit.co, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go. We'll link those up in the show notes so you don't have to read them out loud and type them into your browser if you're driving, or something like that. That's it, that's \#define. This has been a fun one. I wouldn't say it's been a competitive one, but it's had a lot of laughs... And of course, these are our Changelog++ people, so... I think we have 11 minutes. Is that fair, Jamie? You've got 11 minutes to the top of the hour? Alright, so if you are one of us, if you are a Plus Plus member, stick around for a bonus round, right after we say goodbye. Adam, any final words before we hit our bonus round just for the Plus Plus people?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, if you're a Plus Plus subscriber, it's better.

**Jerod Santo:** It's been better for years.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's it.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, bye, friends.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**E. David Aja:** Bye, friends!
