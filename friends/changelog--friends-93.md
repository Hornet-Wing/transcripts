**Jerod Santo:** Welcome to \#define. This is a game of obscure jargon, fake definitions, and expert tomfoolery. Our contestants checked their imposter syndrome at the door, because they either know what these words mean or they're going to fake it till they make their peers think they know. Let's introduce our players in the order they will be playing. First up, she's our female equivalent of Mat Ryer, and if you don't know what I mean, you will know as soon as she begins talking... It's Angelica Hill.

**Angelica Hill:** Hello. I'm very excited to be here! I hope to prove my worth outside of just being the female replacement for Mat Ryer because he couldn't make it today... That is the goal, is to win, and also usurp Mat Ryer as the best Brit on this podcast.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I like your odds. I like your odds. Playing second, our friend fresh off of Oxide & Friends, Matthew Sanabria. What's up, Matt?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Hey, what's up? Glad to be here and fake it, even though I made it, right?

**Jerod Santo:** You did make it. You showed up in the right place, at the right time, but you still might have to fake some things. Playing third - he's mysterious, he's a breakmaster, he's our beat freak... He's Breakmaster Cylinder.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Hi.

**Jerod Santo:** What's up, BMC? How are you?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Fine, I think. Thank you for having me on \[unintelligible 00:05:47.01\]

**Jerod Santo:** We are very excited. We wanted to have you to talk about the new album, Afterparty, but you're like "We've talked about music a lot. Let's do something else." And so I was like "Come play a game with us."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, thanks. I know nothing about this, so it's perfect. I can talk about music --

**Jerod Santo:** But if I were to ask you about our brand new album called Afterparty, what would you say about it?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh God, it's just the best...! Oh, man. The sounds, the notes, the levels...

**Jerod Santo:** The beats...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Unreal.

**Jerod Santo:** And new to the Changelog, but not new to me - we've been Omaha acquaintances for many years. It's John Henry Müller. What's up, man?

**John Henry Müller:** Oh, hey. Hello from Omaha. Here somewhere...

**Jerod Santo:** Hello also from Omaha. Well, the greater Omaha area... Not better than, but just outside. That's where I live.

**John Henry Müller:** Alright.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe also better, I don't know. We'll see. And playing last, because we are gracious hosts around these parts, my partner in podcasting, Adam Stacoviak. What's up, man?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's up? What's up? I'm here to win.

**Jerod Santo:** Fifth time's a charm... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** \#define 5. Here we go.

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, I'll be your not-so-humble host, Jerod Santo. Here is how the game works. We have 10 rounds of play, or 15 points scored, whichever comes first. I will present a word, you all will either know the definition of the word and submit that to me, or you will make up a fake definition that acts as if it's the actual definition, and see if you can trick everyone else into selecting yours.

If you know the correct definition immediately, you get three points and you also get to take a break and sit that round out, because you already know the answer... If after I read all the definitions, you guess the correct one, you get two points, and for each person you trick into selecting your definition, you get one point.

\[07:52\] Now, if all five of you fail in any given round to select the correct definition, I, your not so humble host, receive four points. And if I do that enough times, you all lose, which would be rad, I think. And your word for round one is baryon. Baryon. B-A-R-Y-O-N. Please submit to me your definitions now.

**Angelica Hill:** I'm just adding some finesse to mine. I know the definition, I just need to make sure I've explained it clearly enough.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair. Smart, even. See, this game is nice because you get time to check your email, and maybe code up a feature... It's not like a typical podcast, where you have to be on the whole time.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's nice. I'm going to find a therapist.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You might have enough time.

**John Henry Müller:** We are not allowed to use the internet. I just assume...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, you don't want to ruin the game...

**John Henry Müller:** I mean, nobody wants that...

**Jerod Santo:** Can you hear this?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Ooh, we're off on a quest.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you hear it? You do hear it.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Have you ever played Bomb Corp? It's one of those Jackbox party games...

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Matthew Sanabria:** This sounds like the intro music for it. Basically, you diffuse bombs, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** I was going to say, I've played Bomberman.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. Check it out. It sounds very -- similar vibe.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so Adam and BMC are both trailing indicators. This, I think, is the actual track that I use in the produced episode during this time. It's kind of nice, right?

**Angelica Hill:** Hmm... It's giving me Black Mirror vibes from the recent season.

**Jerod Santo:** This is a BMC original. It's called Study Hall Adventure.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you remember making this one?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I do. I remember the video game I was picturing while writing it.

**Jerod Santo:** Was it Bomb Corp?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Nope. \[laughter\] Maybe, I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** You've made so much music in your life, I wonder if you forget songs, you know?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... Um, yes. Titles, especially.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Alright, Adam's in.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm also known for going last.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, so BMC's winning. Beating you.

**Angelica Hill:** But it's good. You're thoughtful before submission. I got stressed out and submitted it, and then ended up -- I ended up editing the message after I sent it...

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to resubmit?

**Angelica Hill:** No, I can edit the message once I've sent it to you.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I copy it out of there and put it somewhere else. I'll recopy it.

**Angelica Hill:** It was just slight grammatical errors that I needed to correct.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll recopy it then, so I get your edits.

**Angelica Hill:** Thank you. I appreciate that. And I added a little clarification on the end, just to make it crystal clear. Is this on the album?

**Jerod Santo:** No, it is not. This is actually a really long track.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's like 15 minutes long... They were like "Make it one level. Like if it was a hard level and you keep playing it over and over for like an hour. You sort of get used to the same music going over and over. Do it like that."

**Jerod Santo:** I have all definitions for baryon. I will read them now, and then you all will guess which one you think is correct... Starting with Angelica and going from there. So. Baryon - a universally recognized culinary term for a cooking technique that covers the entirety of a cake or pastry in various berries. Berry-covered, or enrobed in berries... It originates from the Greek "berry", for berry, and "on", to put on. So - baryon. That was number one.

\[11:57\] Number two - the byproduct of a chemical reaction between two or more gases. Number three - a particle used as a comparison marker in microscopic weight measurements. Number four - a chemical mixture often used in sterilization for surgery. Number five, a new element under review to be added to the periodic table of elements. And number six, composite particles made up of three quarks, such as protons and neutrons. There you have it, six possible definitions for baryon. It's now up to you all to decide which one is the actual definition. Starting with Angelica. Which one do you think is real?

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, I feel like that chemical, molecular or culinary - these are my three options.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Angelica Hill:** Can I hear the third one again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the third one was "A particle used as a comparison marker in microscopic weight measurements."

**Angelica Hill:** Okay. The one about medical procedures I think isn't right.

**Jerod Santo:** A chemical mixture often used in sterilization? So that's number four. You think that's it, or not it?

**Angelica Hill:** No, not it.

**Jerod Santo:** Why not?

**Angelica Hill:** I just don't think it's correct. Something in my bones tells me. I feel like if a doctor came into my room and said "Oh, we're about to inject you with baryon", I'd be like "No, you're not."

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Very assertive of you.

**John Henry Müller:** "Based on the sound alone, I'm not going to let you do the thing that you went to school to do." Okay...

**Angelica Hill:** No, I mean, I'd ask a little bit more... You know, I need a little bit more context on this strangely-named chemical you're about to put to my body.

**John Henry Müller:** Is that vibe-doctoring?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I think that it might be.

**Angelica Hill:** Just not the vibe. Let's call it something else. \[laughter\]

**John Henry Müller:** Alright...

**Angelica Hill:** I think it might need to be the second one that I asked you to repeat. Which one was that one?

**Jerod Santo:** The second one, or the second one you asked me to repeat?

**Angelica Hill:** The first one that I asked you to repeat...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number three.

**Angelica Hill:** ...that I believe was the third option. Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Number three was "A particle used as a comparison marker in microscopic --" That's yours right there? Okay. We'll lock that in.

**Angelica Hill:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Matthew, which one do you think is real?

**Matthew Sanabria:** There was a number of them, of the definitions around chemical sort of deals... I think there were maybe two or three of them. Can you repeat those?

**Jerod Santo:** So definition number four was a chemical mixture often used in sterilization for surgery.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Number five was a new element... Is that the one you're thinking of, or no?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Possibly.

**Jerod Santo:** And number six was composite particles made up of three quarks.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Quarks or quirks?

**Jerod Santo:** Quarks.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm mean, you're going to need to say that better...

**Jerod Santo:** Q-U-A-R-K-S.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Say it better, Jerod...! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I'm saying it as best as I can. There's also number two, "The byproduct of a chemical reaction between two or more gases."

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, so there's like four chemically definitions.

**Jerod Santo:** There's a lot that are in the same little category, yes. What are you thinking?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I think, since there's so many chemically things...

**Angelica Hill:** Maybe it's wrong.

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds like it would be around -- yeah, it could either go one way. It's either completely wrong, or it's like in the area.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a lot of made-up stuff, man. That's what it is.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay. I'm I think I'm going to choose the one that you couldn't pronounce well.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So quarks?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, that one. Quarks.

**Jerod Santo:** That choice was quirky. Okay. Now we go to BMC. What do you think?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Gases. Yeah, I have notes...

**Jerod Santo:** Good job! I like how efficient you are. It says gases right there.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Tangible. I like having a pencil. It's gas.

**Jerod Santo:** BMC takes two. John Henry, your turn.

**John Henry Müller:** Number three was the one that was the measurement one?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, that's correct.

**John Henry Müller:** I'm going to go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so you're going with Angelica. She picked that one as well. So we have two for that one. And lastly, Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Would it be a total pain to have you repeat them all?

**Jerod Santo:** Absolutely. Which one do you need?

**Adam Stacoviak:** All of them. \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** Which one specifically...?

**Jerod Santo:** \[16:15\] Let me summarize all six, in order, okay? I'm not going to read them verbatim. Number one was the culinary one. Number two was the byproduct of two or more gases. Number three was the one that's used in microscopic weight measurements. Number four is the chemical mixture used in surgery, except for not Angelica's surgeries... Number five, a new element under review to be in the table of elements. And then number six, composite particles made up of three quarks.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking the element. It's the new element.

**Jerod Santo:** You're going for a new element.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Alright, all six answers are in... But who landed on the right definition? Let's start right there where we left off. Adam, you selected a new element under review to be added to the period -- Adam, that was yours.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ahh...! You've gotta go away, boy. I love you.

**Matthew Sanabria:** He's distracted. He was distracted. \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[Did you see Patrick?!\] I know...! Go with Patrick. Mom's away, dads will play, okay? I had to watch a little bit of SpongeBob real quick, but I'm back!

**Jerod Santo:** He's back.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Are you distracted, Adam? Because you selected your own definition?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh no, that was on purpose.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Okay, so selecting your own, while it may trick other people, you get zero points for doing that. And you went last, so the trick couldn't happen either. Interesting. Let's move on to --

**John Henry Müller:** It's safe though, right? Because then you're not --

**Jerod Santo:** It is the safe play. Let's move on to what BMC thought it was - the byproduct of a chemical reaction between two or more gases. He even wrote down "gas" right there on a piece of paper. That was Matthew's. So one point to Matthew...

Speaking of Matthew, he thought it was the quirky one that I couldn't pronounce. And you know what? That's exactly what baryon is. So he got it correct. Baryon, composite particles made up of three quarks, such as protons and neutrons. You get two points.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So everyone \[unintelligible 00:18:13.11\] Okay. We're in this. We know what we're doing now.

**Jerod Santo:** But there are more points to give out, because both Angelica and John Henry piled on to BMC's definition, the weight measurements. That was BMC, so two points, BMC. Not bad.

**John Henry Müller:** Oh, I thought I was tricked. I thought I was tricked by Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** Nope, you were tricked by BMC.

**John Henry Müller:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** But I was right. It was not used for surgical procedures. So my gut instinct was correct.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** A hundred percent correct.

**John Henry Müller:** That was mine...

**Jerod Santo:** That was his. Yeah. Now, there is a baryum, isn't there? Isn't that a thing that they do for like enemas, and stuff?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Beryllium?

**Jerod Santo:** Um... Maybe. I'm just a vibe doctor, not a real doctor. \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** Pure vibes.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so after round one, Matthew's in the lead with three, BMC has two, and the rest of us have not scored quite yet. We move now to round two, and the word for round two is jaggies. Jaggies. J-A-G-G-I-E-S. Jaggies. Please submit your definition for jaggies now.

**John Henry Müller:** Are we saying these are all STEM words?

**Jerod Santo:** Um, they are in the general world of that, but they're not specifically... Just call them like yes-ish...

**John Henry Müller:** So no? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** They aren't strictly STEM, but they are certainly stemmy.

**John Henry Müller:** Because one time you were like... Oh, what was that word? Gallifrey?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**John Henry Müller:** Something with food. It was a big stew.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. In previous games we've had STEM rounds and non-STEM rounds. And today I just decided to just throw out the rules and just do words.

**John Henry Müller:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Adam is in. He's not the last one this time around.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm fighting for my right to party, man.

**Angelica Hill:** \[20:16\] Get your jaggies on...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm trying to move like jaggies.

**Angelica Hill:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** If I didn't know the definition, I would have gone that direction and made y'all laugh.

**Jerod Santo:** Ooh, there's BMC, coming in hot...

**Angelica Hill:** I submitted mine right away, because I already knew what it was.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Simpatico, Angelica. Simpatico. You and me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. We have six definitions for jaggies. Only one of them is actually the definition. Here they are. Number one, containers used to hold raw mining material for being processed. Number two, stair-stepped edges in pixelated graphics due to low resolution or aliasing. Number three, comfortable pants for remote working. A play on jeggings. \[laughter\] Number four, an irregular pathway taken by an object in response to magnetic stimuli. Number five, in digital photography, when an image is not clear, the image will have jaggies. And number six, a Gen Z slang term initially used in colloquial typing and texting to refer to the lightning bolt emoji. And this usage has now transitioned into the realm of software engineering. In this technical context, jaggies indicates sections within code where high computational load or intensive processing is handled, drawing a visual parallel to the sharp, energetic nature of a lightning bolt and its link to electricity. Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh.

**Jerod Santo:** Now you've heard all six definitions. We start with Matthew. Which one do you think is actual?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you repeat, please, number two, four and five? I wrote them down this time, but I didn't get a chance to write them all down.

**Jerod Santo:** It's all good. It's hard to keep track of all this stuff. Number two was the stair-stepped edges in pixelated graphics. Do you want the full thing? Due to low resolution or aliasing... Number four is an irregular pathway taken by an object in response to magnetic stimuli, and number five is in digital photography, when an image is not clear, the image will have jaggies.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay. I'm between two and four here. Stair-stepped edges due to aliasing... That sounds right, but so does the magnetic stimuli of irregular pathways. That sounds fun, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm going to lock in number four, with the magnetic stuff.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, number four locked in. We go now to BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Can you rapidfire go through all of them? As short as you like. I just want to hear how you say it. Go!

**Jerod Santo:** Number one was the containers, the whole raw mining material, number two was the pixelated graphics, number three was comfortable pants, number four was the irregular pathway, number five is the digital photography, and number six was the Gen Z slang term.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm going pants.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I love your conviction. He's going pants. Alright, John Henry, your turn.

**John Henry Müller:** Pants sounds pretty convincing there... Also, the very run-on Gen Z term... Wow. There's so much detail. How can it be wrong, right? I mean, that's... But I think I'm going to have to go with number four, the pathways. That was convincing, and not an obvious sound to the term... So I like that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[23:48\] Piling on with Matthew on number four. How about you, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'll spread it out. I'm going for the last one, because whoever wrote that deserves some points.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam picks the Gen Z slang term for the lightning bolt emoji that turned into a software engineering term... Well, you guys know the rest. Next up, Angelica. Last up, Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** Can you remind me number -- I wrote down two, four, and six. So four, I remember. Two was the jagged edge... What was the two one?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the stair-stepped edges and pixelated graphics due to low resolution or aliasing. And four is the one that Matthew and John Henry both picked.

**Angelica Hill:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** And six is the lightning bolt emoji.

**Angelica Hill:** Jaggies is just too fun to not be to do with something that's visual... But I don't think it's the photography one. As someone who aspires to be able to understand Gen Z, I think I'll go with the last one...

**Jerod Santo:** So you are picking the last one.

**Angelica Hill:** Maybe it'll make me cool. Yeah, I can whip it out if it's correct. Talk to the Gen Zs, get some cred.

**Jerod Santo:** That would be cool. Well, Adam also picked that one, so let's start right there, and see maybe that is what jaggies are. However, Angelica, didn't you write that one?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, I did. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. But you're right. It was so cool, it deserved to be selected. So you don't get any points for selecting it yourself, but you do get one point for getting Adam to select it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** See? Told ya. Simpatico.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, Matthew and John Henry piled onto number four, an irregular pathway taken by an object in response to magnetic stimuli. Well, that was very convincing, and that was BMC's made up definition. Good job, BMC.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Very nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points for you, which means it's up to BMC to actually select correctly. Otherwise, your not so humble host gets the points this round... You thought it was comfortable pants for remote work. A play on jeggings. What do you think? Is that right?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Do I think it's right? It's either that or the stairs thing. But yeah, let's go all in on pants.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] All in on pants and all out on the correct answer. So four points for me. The correct definition of jaggies is stair-stepped edges in pixelated graphics due to low resolution or aliasing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's what I was trying to say with my photography one.

**Jerod Santo:** You were somewhat close. I almost gave you the points...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You should give it to me. That's what it is. That's what I know from photography.

**Jerod Santo:** You used the word jaggies in the definition, and you can't do that. So I just -- I couldn't give it to you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's what I meant...

**John Henry Müller:** Man, these are tough rules.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know where I'm at with this... I'm getting robbed here, y'all.

**Angelica Hill:** Wait, are you not allowed to put the name, the word in the definition? Is that not allowed?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I mean, technically, when you define something, you're not supposed to use the word in the definition.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I didn't know the clinical version of it. I just knew when an image isn't clear, you get those jeggies. The jeggies!

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't think that's usually for photography, though. That's usually more like...

**Jerod Santo:** The context is more video game dev.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, that's what I figured it would be.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. If you had said video games, I probably would have given it to you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I only know it in the context of photography. I'm sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** That's alright.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's like saying a byte is not a byte because you experience it somewhere else. You know, it's still a byte.

**Jerod Santo:** What are you biting into over there? Like someone's leg?

**Adam Stacoviak:** A bit, or a byte?

**Jerod Santo:** That'd be jaggy... Alright, let's move down to round three. Well, hold on. Let's add up these totals, because you know what? I might have just moved into first place. Ooh, I did. I am tied with BMC in first place, with four points. Matthew has three, Angelica one, and so far...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Sir, I think your math is incorrect... Isn't it three for getting someone? Or isn't it three for guessing the correct definition?

**Jerod Santo:** It's three if you guess it initially. It's two if you guess it at the end. So had Adam actually just given me the correct definition, even though he was somewhat close, he would have got three immediately. But if you guess it correctly at the end, you get two.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, okay. If you guess it correctly during... Okay, I understand now.

**Jerod Santo:** After you hear the definitions, yes.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, so your math is correct. I understand now.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you.

**John Henry Müller:** And you get a point when somebody guesses yours?

**Matthew Sanabria:** ...is fooled, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**John Henry Müller:** Like picks your pants?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my bad. You're right.

**John Henry Müller:** Oh, thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair. Fair. Sorry, my math is wrong. \[laughter\] I just didn't write that point down.

**Angelica Hill:** Yours was the pants one, John?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he was the pants one. I just forgot because I was moving on to the fact that I won the round. Yeah, that was a good one. Jeggings. I liked it.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like I'm learning already in this game. The more detailed the answer... Other than Adam, who appreciates it... I've got to keep it short and sweet.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you're writing books over there.

**Angelica Hill:** \[28:10\] Just letting my creativity fly.

**Jerod Santo:** That was very creative. I liked it. It's hard for me to read that long without starting to laugh.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll make them shorter next time.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. I want to represent your definitions well...

**Angelica Hill:** I appreciate it.

**Matthew Sanabria:** ...and the more I'm reading, the more it gets to become kind of funny.

**Angelica Hill:** I hear you, Jerod. I hear you.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, I don't want to shut out John Henry. He has a point. So he got Adam locked in the dungeon now all by himself, and the rest of us on the board. Let's move now to round three, where the word for round three is oobleck. Oobleck. That's O-O-B-L-E-C-K, oobleck.

**Angelica Hill:** It's fun to say, at least...

**Jerod Santo:** It is fun to say. Is it fun to define? We'll find out right after this.

**Break**: \[28:57\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** How do we know that you're giving us the right pronunciation of these words?

**Jerod Santo:** Just take my word for it...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, understood.

**John Henry Müller:** But are you claiming to?

**Matthew Sanabria:** But you've lied about math...

**Jerod Santo:** I make no claims. Neither express or implied. Most of these I looked up the pronunciation. I actually forgot to on this one, but don't Google it, because you'll know the definition... And let me make sure I'm saying it right.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Hold on, maybe this will work. Hey, Siri, define oobleck.

**Jerod Santo:** No, no, no, no, no...

**Angelica Hill:** No...!

**Matthew Sanabria:** Did anyone's thing go off? No? Damn it.

**Jerod Santo:** What, are you trying to get other people the answer?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. Do you think I have Siri enabled on my phone? \[unintelligible 00:31:16.05\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't call her Siri anymore...

**Matthew Sanabria:** She never called me back, so...

**Angelica Hill:** My brother's ex-girlfriend's called Siri.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm sorry for her loss...

**Jerod Santo:** Was that her name, or he just called her that?

**Angelica Hill:** No, that was her legit name.

**Jerod Santo:** That hurts...

**Matthew Sanabria:** So are you giving us the proper pronunciation, or...? I was waiting for that, personally.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my bad. I actually got distracted and started doing something else. \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** I was just waiting for that. I was just curious.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. I just confirmed. It's oobleck, specifically as I said it.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So since you said you check your email during this, and you also said that not every email gets a response, is now a good time to email you?

**Jerod Santo:** This would be a great time, actually.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, perfect.

**Jerod Santo:** This reminds me, while we wait for BMC, you guys may or may not know that I have an entire soundboard of BMC noises.

**John Henry Müller:** \[32:10\] Really?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I just like anything that makes me happy. And I do that. And then I do the next thing. You're welcome. \[laughter\]Words to live by... Do this thing. Like glitchy things, and... Things-things.

**John Henry Müller:** Okay, that's my definition.

**Jerod Santo:** Here's my favorite one. "Heckings yeah, I said to myself." \[laughter\] Sometimes I throw those in at the end of the show, when I'm thanking you for making our beats...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes, I've heard.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you've heard? Nice. This one -- I'll usually throw in this one. "I'm here for your sound needs."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Hold on, I'm getting distracted by all those smart, funny things I say. One second.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you still need jobs? "If you're listening, I need jobs. Thank you."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That was just me talking \[unintelligible 00:33:03.16\] Please give me work...

**Jerod Santo:** "Please give me work..." \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** You sound like Batman.

**Jerod Santo:** He does.

**Angelica Hill:** You're both Batman and a Spiderman, evil octopus man at the same time.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Aw, thank you...

**Angelica Hill:** You're welcome. I love a backhanded compliment.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, cool. Aw, man... \[laughter\] I actually really do like your goggles.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, thank you.

**Angelica Hill:** If I could get prescription goggles, that would be awesome. But I can't see past like two inches of my face, so...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Right.

**Angelica Hill:** ...I would need them to be very heavy.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. I like these. They have saved my face.

**Angelica Hill:** From what?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Uh, doorways. Door frames. One of these is shattered, and there was --

**Matthew Sanabria:** I was going to say, you can't hit doorways, but you can hit door frames or doors...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** This was going to be my face, and instead it shattered this. And \[unintelligible 00:34:04.07\] very lucky.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, okay.

**John Henry Müller:** The end.

**Angelica Hill:** Do you routinely hit into door frames?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I did that one time...

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, okay.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's why I bought these. It was like "One day I'm going to go face first into a door for no reason..."

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we have all definitions for oobleck... And this round will be a little different than the rest, because two of our contestants actually got the correct definition for oobleck. Three points awarded to Angelica and John Henry. You guys both know what oobleck is.

**Angelica Hill:** Yes, John!

**Jerod Santo:** The rest of us will have to find out. So we'll actually only have four definitions. Since those two were the correct definitions, they merged down into the real one... And we start with - oobleck, a non-Newtonian fluid that acts as both a liquid and solid under stress. Number two, oobleck - similar to an umlaut, an oobleck is used to indicate the pronunciation of a word. Number three, a piece of communication network that filters some data while setting aside others for future dispatch. And number four, a gritty adhesive formed by mixing sand water and epoxy. So four definitions of oobleck. One of those is correct. Angelica and John Henry sit this round out, since they already know what it is. And BMC gets to pick first.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** First one.

**Jerod Santo:** First one, the non-Newtonian fluid. Okay, BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You said it funny.

**Jerod Santo:** We go to Adam. It is funny.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's the last one again? The gritty substance?

**Jerod Santo:** A gritty adhesive formed by mixing sand water and epoxy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh yeah, that's it.

**Jerod Santo:** That's it. Adam takes that one. We go now to Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So I heard the first one was the non-Newtonian something or other...

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Matthew Sanabria:** The last one was gritty adhesive. What were the middle two?

**Jerod Santo:** \[35:59\] The middle two was similar to an umlaut. An umlaut is used to indicate the pronunciation of a word. And the other middle one was a piece of a communication network that filters some data while setting aside other for future dispatch.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That one's spelled incorrectly. There's some mistakes in that one, so I'm going to pass on that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm thinking one -- one sounds the best here... And I don't know if this group would say something like non-Newtonian... So I think I'm going to lock in for one, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So not only does he select number one, he also disses everybody... \[laughter\] "This group wouldn't say non-Newtonian. They aren't smart enough."

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:36:41.11\] out there.

**Matthew Sanabria:** A bunch of mids...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**John Henry Müller:** But we knew what it was, so...

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good point. So Angelica and John Henry already knew that oobleck was a non-Newtonian fluid that acts as both a liquid and a solid under stress. So BMC and Matthew each get two points for guessing it correctly.

**John Henry Müller:** Did you guys not go to elementary school, or...? You guys don't know what this is?

**Jerod Santo:** I just skipped straight to --

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't know how you know what it is. So can you please explain to me what contents we're all missing?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Please.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The cornstarch and water mixture that you can punch, and that feels solid, and then you hold it and it drips through your fingers...

**Matthew Sanabria:** I went outside as a kid, I don't know what you're talking about. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So this is also a commercial product, I guess. When, Angelica, you were talking about the commercial product, right?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. Ooey-gooey.

**Jerod Santo:** She called it an ooey-gooey kid's toy like slime, but more \[unintelligible 00:37:43.28\] with specks in it... Which is true.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Interesting. You know, I've never heard this in my life.

**Jerod Santo:** I actually hadn't heard of oobleck either, so... I'm very impressed by you two.

**Angelica Hill:** \[unintelligible 00:37:53.00\] me and John, we're just slimy.

**John Henry Müller:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** And then Adam selected the gritty adhesive formed by mixing sand water and epoxy, and that's Matthew's, so he gets another point. So three points for you, three points for Angelica, two for BMC, three for John Henry... Adam and I shut out this round. So after three rounds, tied for first is Matthew and BMC, with six. Tied for second is Angelica, John Henry and myself with four, and we leave Adam where he was previously. Let's move now to round four... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** I have faith in you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I do not.

**Jerod Santo:** "I do not." \[laughter\]

**John Henry Müller:** There's a strategy.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. He has a strategy. This round is a little different. We call this give it a goog. Give it a goog! Where I went out to Google in an incognito browser window - so no personalization - and I started giving it a goog. Then I stopped and checked for the first autocomplete. Your job is to come up with what the first autocomplete was, or ostensibly what you can trick other people into thinking that it was. The query that I queried was "When does the". I typed "When does the", and then I stopped. What do you think Google suggested as the number one autocomplete? Please submit to me your autocompletes now.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Did you do this search or this autocomplete yourself, on your machine?

**Jerod Santo:** Incognito window. VPN.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And can you put the text that you put in the channel?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, for sure. Adam was the first one in this time, so he's...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, that's because I know the answer.

**Jerod Santo:** He's changing things around.

**Angelica Hill:** How often do you write that into Google to get the answer to that?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, this one's obvious...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, the cool thing about it is it's kind of a proxy for the human condition, is it not? Like, what were people asking it? What do people wonder? When does the...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** When does the fox say?

**Jerod Santo:** \[40:00\] I was thinking of that, too. That's "What does the fox say?" Very close, though.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, dang. That's what I said.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And did you do this today? This search, such a search?

**Jerod Santo:** I don't answer any further questions.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, that's fair.

**Angelica Hill:** That's very relevant now.

**Matthew Sanabria:** It is really relevant.

**Jerod Santo:** What does the fox say?

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, when you did this.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Yeah, like if it was like six years ago... It'd be super-different.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's prepared for this show a long time ago.

**John Henry Müller:** He's been doing this... Yeah, he planned this.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Where did he come from? Where did he go? \[unintelligible 00:40:30.05\] BMC is with me...

**Jerod Santo:** BMC is here for our sound needs. \[If you're listening, I need jobs. Thank you.\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm here for your sound needs... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's kind of more fun when BMC is here than it even is when he's not.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm having fun when he's here... Oh, God... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we're just down to one person not in.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Buy my music! \[laughter\] Buy my music.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good soundbite. Next time we release an album we'll just play that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** At the end.

**Jerod Santo:** On repeat.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Or at the beginning.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do it. You chose phrases that have -- I don't know. They don't have much \[unintelligible 00:41:20.26\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[Yeah...!\] That's a good one, right?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, okay. I'm on board with that. Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Six potential Google autocompletes for "When does the..." Number one, "When does the current administration end?" Number two, "When does the sun rise?" Number three, "When does the time change?" Number four, "When does the stock market open?" Number five, "When does the sun set near me?" And number six, "When does the world end?" Existential. Alright, six potential "When does the's". John Henry?

**John Henry Müller:** So going through these... What was the first one?

**Jerod Santo:** The current administration.

**John Henry Müller:** Oh, that... Yeah, that's -- I'm certainly wondering that. But I don't know... I don't know if Google would go there. Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, it would.

**John Henry Müller:** It would?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** But also, is this global Google, though? Or is this U.S. based?

**John Henry Müller:** This is Jerod's incognito.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Jerod's IP address in Omaha, or whatever...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I didn't VPN very far.

**John Henry Müller:** Sunrise is plausible...

**Jerod Santo:** They're all plausible, actually.

**John Henry Müller:** Stock market... Sunset near me... I like the near me.

**Jerod Santo:** Does that mean the sunsets like as close to you as possible, or...?

**John Henry Müller:** I don't know. Google just always like adds that in those searches, and so that's what made me think... I'm going with number five.

**Jerod Santo:** Number five, "When does the sun set near me?" Okay. Adam, what do you think?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I haven't been paying attention, sorry. \[laughter\] What are we doing here?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Well, the scoreboard accurately reflects that, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What are we doing here...?

**Jerod Santo:** Are you still watching SpongeBob?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I am, actually... Patrick's so awesome. Let's see here. There are two that are near me. Which ones are those? Read those to me, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, one was "When does the sun set near me?" That's number five. And then the other one was "When does the sun rise?", but it does not say near me. Number five is the only one that says near me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's the Mandela effect, I think. I remember both of them saying near me.

**Jerod Santo:** No... We would all have to remember it. Otherwise, it's just you being wrong.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's see here... What was the first one again?

**Jerod Santo:** The first one was "When does the current administration end?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** What about number two? Do you think number two is the right answer?

**Jerod Santo:** When does the sun rise?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Near me?

**Jerod Santo:** No. \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** \[43:57\] That could be your additional add-on...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Would it change your answer if it said "near me"...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I feel like near me is probably accurate, but I'm not going to go that route. I'm going to go with number two, and locking it in tight.

**Jerod Santo:** Locking in "When does the sun rise?" Okay. Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** I don't think it's the administration one, and I don't think it's the world end one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So you're down to four then.

**Angelica Hill:** So I've got the two someones, and the time zone stock market. I don't think the stock market is broadly applicable to the world, so I don't think that many people would google that. Famous last words \[unintelligible 00:44:33.22\] I'm going on what I would care about. I care about when the sun rises and sets, so I'm also on the line of thinking of "Is the near me gonna be--" I think last time I locked in with Adam, it was good, so I'm going to lock in with Adam. Two.

**Jerod Santo:** You're going with Adam. Okay. When does the sun rise.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We're sympathetically incorrect.

**Angelica Hill:** I put my faith in you, Adam. So I'm like...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Matt.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you give me the quick rundown of all of them again?

**Jerod Santo:** Number one is the current administration, number two is the sun rising, number three is the time changing, number four is the market opening, number five is the sun setting near me, and number six is the world ending.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay. I haven't used Google in a very long time, so I don't know what Google even suggests anymore... I've also never seen a suggestion ever say near me, so I think that one's out for me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's not true.

**Angelica Hill:** Nor have I, honestly... I also don't autocorrect much.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. I've never seen a near me thing pop up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It already knows where you're at. It's \[unintelligible 00:45:38.26\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** Right. Exactly. It already knows -- they already know where you are.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Near me's are specific nouns, like "Where is the nearest gas station near me?" That's when you put the near me.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. I think if you had started with that, then the near me would have autocorrected.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, sunrise and sunset are geographically dependent, righ? The un set at a different time, in different places.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, but I feel like Google has evolved, but it knows my geo.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. What are you thinking, Matthew?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Alright. So if you're doing this from Omaha... I'm torn between the sunrise and the stock market, honestly. But I think we've over-indexed on the sunrise, so I think I'm going to go the other way and do the stock market opening.

**Jerod Santo:** Nice. Playing the spread. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** When the world ends, huh? Okay. Good job.

**Angelica Hill:** You're going to lose. \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's a good choice, when the world ends.

**Angelica Hill:** That's not right.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is that what you picked?

**Jerod Santo:** No, he picked the stock market.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I thought I said when the world ends. I mean, come on. That's the right answer.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Come on, that's the right answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Lastly, BMC. What do you think? World end? \[unintelligible 00:46:37.27\] \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** I wonder who wrote that one...

**Jerod Santo:** End of days... Fan finger. What are those things called? Giant hand?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I got this in 2020, and it's going to be useful sometime.

**Jerod Santo:** Eventually it will apply.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Every five years, useful.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so BMC picks the world ending. Adam was very excited that you were interested in the world ending, because Adam wrote the world ending. So one point for Adam. When the world ends.

**Angelica Hill:** See, I had faith in you, Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I would keep doing that. It's amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** John Henry was interested in the sun setting near him... And nobody else was interested in that one. It happened to be his own, so he gets zero points. \[laughter\] Couldn't quite bring people along for the ride...

**John Henry Müller:** I was trying to lobby that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it almost worked, but... Then they were all using logic, and stuff. Let's see, what else...

**John Henry Müller:** I see that. I see the near me all the time.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, do you?

**John Henry Müller:** Yeah. You guys don't?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't use Google...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I guess I don't really think about the autocomplete much.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I mean in Maps, maybe, when I'm like looking for like a Chick-fil-A near me...

**Jerod Santo:** Like search nearby.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's where I see the near me's.

**Angelica Hill:** \[47:52\] That's like a button there. You can press near me.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. \[unintelligible 00:47:53.02\]

**John Henry Müller:** I saw a dentist that was named something like Near Me for SEO reasons...

**Jerod Santo:** Smart...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was his last name?

**John Henry Müller:** \[laughs\] Near me. It was his last name.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dr. Near me.

**John Henry Müller:** Dr. Near me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Paging Dr. Near me...

**Jerod Santo:** If I was a doctor, I'd name myself "On the plane." "Is there a doctor on the plane?" I'd just get hit every time. The sun rising was also popular with Adam and Angelica... Adam picked it because he thought it was right, and Angelica picked it because she thought she could fool more people, I guess, because that's hers... So she gets one point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You reduce the addition to others.

**Angelica Hill:** See, I had faith in you giving me points, Adam. And it worked!

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was doing that on purpose. I felt the brainwaves coming through, like an oblack, or what the heck is that thing called...?

**Angelica Hill:** Like an oblack?

**Jerod Santo:** Like an ooblack. A jaggy ooblack. Nobody picked the time change. That was Matthew's. Nobody picked the current administration ending. That was BMC's. Also, there's a time limit on it, right? So people don't ask that question. It's four years... Minus whatever hundred days.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, it's going to be like 12 years if he has anything to do with it.

**Jerod Santo:** Well... Yeah, we'll see how many administrations there are. And then Matthew picked the stock market, which was the actual answer, Angelica. So you need to eat some crow here...

**Angelica Hill:** Really?

**Jerod Santo:** "When does the stock market open?" is the number one autocomplete for "When does the."

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, no... Can I check this now?

**Jerod Santo:** Here's the number two, three and four and five autocompletes. "When does the time change?" So Matthew, you actually had the second-best autocomplete.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I've googled that before. Or I've searched that before.

**Jerod Santo:** You get zero points. But you do get two for getting it right, so good job there. "When does the WNBA season start?" So shout-out to Caitlin Clark for probably affecting those results. WNBA, very popular all of a sudden. And then "When do the NBA playoffs start?" Of course, that's -- they're going on right now. And then the last one, number five, was "When does the sun set?" No near me, though, John Henry. So you were close...

**John Henry Müller:** But I only care about near me, because...

**Jerod Santo:** Because you're a narcissist.

**John Henry Müller:** ...it's rolling. It's setting somewhere all the time.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. That's fair, I think.

**Angelica Hill:** I tried this out right now, after submitting... And I think it's subjective to where you are. Because my top one is "When does the Minecraft movie come out?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** Are you logged in?

**Angelica Hill:** That was my top. I'm Incognito mode. I put "When does the" and it says Minecraft movie.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, everybody right now go incognito and do a search. And John Henry and I are very closely approximate to each other, so we'll see if he gets what I got.

**Angelica Hill:** When does the Minecraft movie come out? And then when does the time change? And then when does the time change 2025. My three options.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I pretty much have the same thing, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** My top search is "When does the world end." Geez...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**John Henry Müller:** Mine is "When does the sun rise?" And then number two is "When does the MLB season start near me?" I don't know how that got in there. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Near me. That's spectacular, because it starts the same time everywhere. But maybe they just -- maybe Google fingerprinted me somehow, even though I'm incognito... And it's like "This guy wants to know when the stock market opens." Even though I've never searched that in my life.

**Matthew Sanabria:** You did mention Slack shares and stuff, so... It knows. You have stocks in your mind.

**Jerod Santo:** I do know what the stock market is. This is true. I do know what it is.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like mine was the number one on John's browser, so I should at least get like a half point. Come on.

**John Henry Müller:** It's integers only. I'm sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** Hold on, John Henry's doing another one now...

**John Henry Müller:** Different from my browser?

**Angelica Hill:** No, it's not, John. It's correct.

**John Henry Müller:** But then when I go to google.com and the autocomplete - that's different.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's what I did. Google.com.

**Angelica Hill:** I think the browser is definitely correct.

**Jerod Santo:** The browser address bar is probably using your stuff there. Anyways...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:51:53.00\] see Minecraft... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[51:56\] Alright, so after four rounds now, we have Matthew in a commanding lead with eight, followed by BMC with six, Angelica with five, John Henry and I are tied with four, and Adam's on the board now with one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Half a point.

**Matthew Sanabria:** How many points, BMC? This many points for Adam. You have the finger.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. BMC, one finger move... It's the right finger at least.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's true.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. We move now to round five. This is a brand new format. We've never done this one before. I call it "Weird flicks, but okay", where I have gone out and found a weird old movie. And your job - I will give you the title and the date, the year that movie came out, and your job is to write the tagline or the synopsis, the one-sentence synopsis of the movie, having known nothing but the title and the year it came out. Makes sense?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. The movie that's tagline you're going to write was a 1924 flick called "He Who Gets Slapped." "He Who Gets Slapped." Now, you are in charge of the actual synopsis. Please submit those to me whenever they're ready.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it a talkie?

**Jerod Santo:** Like those chips that are real spicy?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No... Like a movie that had spoken \[unintelligible 00:53:30.29\] and they ate chips.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**John Henry Müller:** Today we call those movies...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Well, I haven't been \[unintelligible 00:53:37.09\] for a while.

**Jerod Santo:** I actually haven't seen it. I do know its title and the synopsis though. It could have been a talkie...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** This is from 19 black and white...

**Jerod Santo:** I tried to find one of the most obscure movies I could, just hoping nobody's seen it. I think I did good.

**Angelica Hill:** Are you going to be reading these in a cinematic voice, Jerod? I feel like you should. You should fully commit.

**Jerod Santo:** In a world...! I don't have a Batman voice.

**Angelica Hill:** What is it \[unintelligible 00:54:05.02\] dark and foreboding.

**Jerod Santo:** I do try to be foreboding though. Weird flicks, but okay... We have six potential synopses for the 1924 movie "He Who Gets Slapped." I will read you these now. Number one. "Young George's mischievous childhood was punctuated by the sharp sting of a cane. Now an adult, he wakes to phantom slams and inexplicable cane-shaped bruises. Is it madness? His imagination? Or is his past literally leaving its mark? A chilling psychological thriller based on a true story of buried trauma and the repercussions of being a naughty boy." \[laughter\] Okay, number two.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:54:52.27\] Angelica... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** A high school student hopelessly searches for love while continuously facing rejection, often physical. Number three. A scared, straight, short film describing the purported hazards of befriending communists."

**Adam Stacoviak:** BMC.

**Jerod Santo:** Number four. A bitter clown endeavors to rescue the young woman he loves from the lecherous baron who once betrayed him. Number five. In a world where hand gestures have gone too far, a group of friends vow to change things and restore the old ways of simple handshakes and high fives. And number six. When a man decides a raucous night out on the big city is more important than his life back home. Which of these six very well written, I might say, synopses is actually the one for the 1924 flick He Who Gets Slapped? We start with Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... I was too busy thinking about who's who and what's what... I forgot to listen. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You had one job, which was to listen.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, actually, I just need two and four and the last one, I think.

**Jerod Santo:** So just two, four and six. So half of them. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, please.

**Jerod Santo:** \[56:14\] Number two, "A high school student hopelessly searches for love while continuously facing rejection, often physical." Four was "A bitter clown endeavors to rescue the young woman he loves from the lecherous baron who once betrayed him."

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's Matt.

**Jerod Santo:** And number six is "When a man decides a raucous night out on the big city is more important than his life back home."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who do I want to get points to...?

**Jerod Santo:** So you think you know who wrote each one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah... \[laughter\] Pegged. Can I get some points for that?

**Jerod Santo:** It could be, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Guess who?!

**Jerod Santo:** You can certainly guess who, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...with a twist.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that'd be a good game.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm going to give BMC some points... Read number three again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** A scared straight short film describing the purported hazards of befriending communists.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's totally BMC. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Matthew Sanabria:** What was the clown one? That was number four?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** The clown was four. Three was communists. Two is physical rejection. The first one was young George and his is mischievous childhood. He got caned as a kid. \[laughter\] What are you going to do, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I just already said.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I couldn't hear you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I gave the points to the number three, BMC.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, number three, BMC. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** All the way.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam votes number three. Okay, we go now to Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** Obviously, we all know which one I think it was...

**Jerod Santo:** We do... Which one do you actually think it is?

**Angelica Hill:** What I actually think it is is the last one, I think. The one about the raucous night out and leaving one's family behind. It feels very 1920s man to me.

**Jerod Santo:** Angelica picks number six, locks it in. Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm going to double on that.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. She also picks number six. The raucous night out is...

**Matthew Sanabria:** It gives very 1920s vibes, you know? Who uses raucous anymore? Nobody uses that word anymore.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, who says raucous...? Right.

**Angelica Hill:** The flappers, and like jazz music...

**Jerod Santo:** The flapper, the big city, you know...

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, I can see it.

**Jerod Santo:** ...raucous nights out... Okay. John Henry, are you going to go raucous?

**John Henry Müller:** Oh, I don't know... I mean, yeah, I like the raucous part, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a pile on. Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Is that a pile on?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Where's Mat when you need him to sing a song...?

**John Henry Müller:** I'm going to go with number four, the clown.

**Jerod Santo:** He's not piling on. He's playing the spread and he's going with the clown. BMC, what are you going with?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Raucous.

**Jerod Santo:** He's going raucous. Wow. Now, that's a pile on right there...

**Angelica Hill:** Adding to George's poor trauma... He never gets picked.

**Jerod Santo:** Young George's mischievous childhood... Of course, we all do know that Angelica wrote that book about a movie... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** What gave it away...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** She duped all of you.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Practically had the entire script written.

**John Henry Müller:** It was a screenplay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it was a screenplay. \[laughs\] It was more of a review than even a synopsis. Good job, Angelica. Very well written. I enjoyed it from. It was a raucous night out. That was hers, nobody picked it. Scared straight short film... Alright, so one point for BMC. And the pile on - Angelica, Matthew and BMC were all out on for a raucous night out. John Henry did not pile on. Any thoughts as to why maybe he didn't pick it? Well, because he wrote it...

**John Henry Müller:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** Big time... Big time. Three points there. And he's no clown. He's got the right answer as well. He got two, because the actual synopsis of He Who Gets Slapped is "A bitter clown endeavors to rescue the young woman he loves from the lecherous baron who once betrayed him."

**Matthew Sanabria:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** How'd you know that, John Henry?

**John Henry Müller:** Well, my grandfather wrote the screenplay...

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:00:13.17\] \[laughs\]

**John Henry Müller:** I'm just kidding. No, it just seemed like nobody would add a clown into theirs unless they were like -- it's just like, it's not quite funny, but it's kind of like too weird to... You wouldn't add that to make it like "Oh no, that's not what a movie is about." So I was like "Okay, that's just weird enough..."

**Jerod Santo:** Good thinking. Yeah, there's no clown inclinations in the title at all, and it's not quite weird enough to be funny... But it is weird enough to be the actual synopsis of a 1924 movie, and a big score. So you got three for foolering, and two for getting it correct, so that's a five point round.

**John Henry Müller:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** And BMC is the only other person that scored that round with one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Big score.

**Jerod Santo:** So - big score, bringing you into first place with nine points, passing Matthew with eight, BMC with seven, Angelica with five, me with four, Adam with one. Still anybody's game there...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I've got the bonus point for getting the side quest.

**Jerod Santo:** You drilled the side quest. How many points do you get for knowing that BMC wrote that one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** At least a half a point, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we'll give you a half...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sweet.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam with 1.5.

**Adam Stacoviak:** 1.3. Let's go down to 1.3.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we'll give you a third. 1.3 repeating decimal.

**Break**: \[01:01:34.27\]

**Jerod Santo:** We move now to round six, where the word for round six is penumbra.

**Angelica Hill:** So back to the original definition...

**Jerod Santo:** That's correct. This is a regular round. Penumbra, spelled P-E-N-U-M-B-R-A. And you can submit to me your definitions whenever you have them.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I have to think of how to how to word mine.

**Angelica Hill:** Clearly it's not correct then, is it?

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's up to Jerod to decide, miss... \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** I think it's actually up to the Oxford Dictionary to decide... Mister...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oxford can't even decide where to place a comma, so we don't talk to them.

**Jerod Santo:** Haah...!

**Angelica Hill:** Well, you are talking about American English, as opposed to the actual English, so...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Aren't you in America?

**Angelica Hill:** Yes... Does that mean I have to adhere to your grammatical errors? No...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Excuse me, I don't make grammatical errors.

**Angelica Hill:** Excuse me. No, you just say "like" 52 times within an hour...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Listen, okay? I tried... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:03:43.15\] Alright, we have six definitions for penumbra, one of which is the correct definition... And three points before the round begins goes to Matthew. He has the correct definition. He knows what a penumbra is. So you're going to sit this one out. Congrats. You've already scored three. And we go now to five definitions. Number one, "An area in which something exists to a lesser or uncertain degree." Number two, "The largest in a list of numbers." Number three, "The second to final stage of a nerve receptor's lifecycle." Number four, "What's the matter with you, huh? Penumbra." Number five, "A geographical or astrological term for a peninsula or a concave piece of land that is in shade on the planet." Angelica goes first... Which one do you think is a penumbra?

**Angelica Hill:** I think I'm between the second one...

**Jerod Santo:** Which was the largest in a list of numbers...

**Angelica Hill:** Yes, like the penultimate... Penumbra. That resonated with my brain. I'm just going to go with that one. Now that I'm talking it through in my brain, it's resonating.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. She's locking that one in. Okay. Now we go to -- or we skip Matthew, because he's correct, and we go to BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Could you say the first three again?

**Jerod Santo:** Number one was an area in which something exists to a lesser or uncertain degree. Number two was the largest in a list of numbers. And number three was the second to final stage of a nerve receptor's lifecycle.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** My knowledge of prefixes is getting in my way.

**Jerod Santo:** I hate it when that happens...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Me too... Thank you. No one ever says that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The first one.

**Jerod Santo:** The first one. Okay. BMC picks an area in which something exists to a lesser or an uncertain degree.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That means nothing.

**Jerod Santo:** We go now to John Henry.

**John Henry Müller:** I'm going to go with the largest number. That seems the most logical.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Piling on with Angelica. Going now to Adam...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Angelica chose her own. Let's see here...

**Jerod Santo:** She says she didn't.

**Angelica Hill:** I refute that claim.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No one puts a baby in the corner. Or in the shadows...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm going with the shadow.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Where are you putting babies?

**Angelica Hill:** In the sha-- in the penumbra...

**Adam Stacoviak:** In the penumbra. What's the matter with you, huh? Penumbra. Obviously...

**Jerod Santo:** Which number is the shadow?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know. Five, or something. Six.

**John Henry Müller:** It was the last one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The peninsula, with the shadow occurring deep within the jungle...

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha. Alright, so Adam goes to that one. Alright, so we'll start right there. Adam thought Angelica picked her own, but then Adam picked Angelica's. That was --

**Adam Stacoviak:** See, I was just trying to help you out, Angelica. I just cut you down, put you right back up. That's the way I do it.

**Angelica Hill:** I appreciate it.

**Jerod Santo:** Angelica thought it was the largest in a list of numbers... So did John Henry... That's because he wrote it, so he gets one point for fooling one person.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I knew someone was going with their own. This tactic is not getting old.

**John Henry Müller:** You used that tactic.

**Adam Stacoviak:** One time. First round. Just to open it up. Let you know it could be possible.

**Jerod Santo:** Just showing you the possibilities.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. I'm here to teach you how to play the game.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Thanks, man.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm simply level one. I'm level one.

**Jerod Santo:** And BMC thought it was an area in which something exists to a lesser or uncertain degree. That is a penumbra. So two points for BMC. That's one of the definitions. The other one is a partial shadow caused when an object does not completely block a light source. That's what Matthew wrote down.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, dang...

**Jerod Santo:** Or the diffuse outer part of a sunspot... Maybe -- you were really close, Angelica. That's why you convinced --

**Angelica Hill:** I knew it was some shadowy thing. I half-knew it, and I couldn't remember what the actual...

**Jerod Santo:** So close you tricked somebody. Penumbra.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Like umbrella?

**Jerod Santo:** Like umbrella.

**Matthew Sanabria:** \[01:07:50.27\] No, this one was an interesting one... I knew this one immediately when you wrote it, for two reasons. One, I knew my prefix and suffix here. Thank you, Pokemon. Umbreon. Espeon. And then also, when I was doing lighting for my kitchen, when I was placing lights for the ceiling and finding out where to do it, there's always that secondary shadow that's cast under the cabinets... And I wanted to minimize that as much as possible, and I was like "How do I do that?" And that's where I found that term.

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And I was like "Oh, that's what that secondary shadow is called."

**Adam Stacoviak:** It is a science. Kitchen lighting is a science.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So yeah, that's what it is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. No penumbras in my house.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's the matter with you, huh? \[laugher\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm not sure what Adam wrote there... "What's the matter with you, huh? Penumbra." Can you explain the logic on that one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just make y'all laugh a little bit, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha. Oh, yeah. It got a laugh. Alright, so three points for Matthew, two for BMC, one for Angelica, one for John Henry... Bringing Matthew into first place with 11, John Henry with 10, BMC with nine, Angelica with six, me with four, and Adam with 1.3, repeating decimal. Alright, we're getting late in the game now... Round seven of a potential 10 rounds. This is a different round. It's called "How do you do, fellow humans?" Because I have went out to ChatGPT and given it a prompt, and it has responded. I wrote down its response. Your job is to act as if you are fellow humans and fellow ChatGPTers, and write your own response to this prompt. The prompt is "Create a new word in the world of science fiction and give it a one sentence definition. It should be both interesting and memorable." So I've written down ChatGPT's response... You will write down your response as if you are a ChatGPT, to this prompt. Put it in the chat, I'll read it again for our listener... Create a new word in the world of science fiction, and give it a one-sentence definition. It should be both interesting and memorable.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Are y'all thinking, or done already?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Thinking...

**Jerod Santo:** They're thinking. I have zero submissions.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\] I love this game.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam's making himself laugh. "What's the matter with you, huh? Penumbra." Is that supposed to be read in the Rocky voice? \[laughter\] Oh, if I can't get me, I get Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Oh, gosh... Oh, no...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's gonna be a good round.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, no...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You have to enunciate it. Okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Nope... Oh, it's gonna be a tough one, to read all these... Gotta play it straight.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I'm crying. I'm crying.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, this one's hard, I'm not gonna lie to you. This one's really hard.

**Jerod Santo:** Good. A little challenge for your Tuesday afternoon...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm gonna keep going there, Jerod, I'm just gonna maybe augment it a little bit, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Are you gonna change it now?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I'm gonna go the same direction, I just didn't do a good job.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... \[laughter\] Angelica, you just submitted a second one, or you just clarified it for me?

**Angelica Hill:** I just thought it would be fun... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** She's like "I just came back for more..."

**Angelica Hill:** I just added a supplementary meme.

**Jerod Santo:** I do like that meme.

**Angelica Hill:** It's like illustrative.

**Jerod Santo:** Am I supposed to include that in your actual...?

**Angelica Hill:** It's up to you. I'll give you creative discretion.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is at your discretion, Jerod. You just go whichever direction you want to go, okay? I just need you to enunciate. Remember, enunciate.

**Angelica Hill:** \[01:12:02.17\] I was so close to writing a description of a new word that was fit with my favorite sticker on my water bottle...

**John Henry Müller:** It looks like Krang.

**Jerod Santo:** It kind of does look -- from Ninja Turtles?

**John Henry Müller:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**John Henry Müller:** But it's stuck in a Game Boy...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh yeah, it does. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Why? Where? Why --

**Angelica Hill:** Just for like funsies... It makes me laugh.

**Jerod Santo:** It is funny, but where'd you get it?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. I also have a \[unintelligible 01:12:29.03\]

**John Henry Müller:** What do they sell there?

**Angelica Hill:** \[unintelligible 01:12:33.06\]

**Jerod Santo:** She just answered that one straight.

**Angelica Hill:** This one was actually made by the \[unintelligible 01:12:40.08\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Have you seen that one thing -- it's a worm, or tiger tail... It's a thing, you know? Is it a worm, or is it a tiger tail?

**Angelica Hill:** I have seen that. I'm not very good at guessing, though. I feel like if I could touch it, I could tell.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** Definitely.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. We have six potential real responses from ChatGPT. Only one of them is the real response. To the prompt, "Create a new word in the world of science fiction and give it a one-sentence definition. It should be both interesting and memorable." Response number one, neuroforge. A noun. A clandestine device implanted in the cerebral cortex, that allows its user to overwrite memories with synthetic experiences, blurring the line between reality and engineered perception.

Number two, "I would be happy to. Here's a new word for you. Osobuna, a spherical shield around itself that is completely impenetrable and indestructible to everything." Number three, "Great idea. How about Zinnus - a rare plant with mystical healing properties. That could provide a sci-fi spin on a familiar story element." Number four, "Darlorgon, the powerful hybrid offspring of a rogue Dalric and a Gorgon." \[laughs\] Sorry. "Their union was born..." \[laughs\] Sorry... "Their union was born out of both love and due to the potent essence of the Gorgon spit--" \[laughs\] Sorry... "As reproductive properties. This has resulted in a uniquely resilient new species within the matrix." Number five, "Certainly. Here's your new science fiction word that's both interesting and memorable. Aplerite. The treatment of a porous substance to fill all its vessels and create a single entity. Let me know if you'd like more words. I can even use it in a sentence for you." And number six, "Jaggies. Comfortable pants for remote working. A play on jeggings." \[laughter\]

Okay, there's six, frankly, spectacular responses by ChatGPT wannabes... And we'll see who's who. Angelica, you get to pick first. Which one do you like the most?

**Angelica Hill:** Can I hear --

**Matthew Sanabria:** One through six? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to hear number four again? Darlorgon?

**Angelica Hill:** Three and four, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, three and four. Three says "Great idea. How about Zinnus?" Or Zynus? It's Z-I-N-N-U-S. A rare plant with mystical healing properties that could provide a sci-fi spin on a familiar story element. And number four was Darlorgon, the powerful hybrid offspring of a rogue Dalric and a Gorgon. Their union was born out of both love and due to the potent... \[laughter\] And due to the potent essence of the Gorgon's spit and its reproductive properties. This has resulted in a uniquely resilient new species within the matrix.

**Angelica Hill:** \[01:16:08.20\] That one.

**Jerod Santo:** That one. \[laughter\] Okay, Angelica goes for that one. Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you repeat one and two?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. One was Neuroforge, a clandestine device implanted in the cerebral cortex, that allows its user to overwrite memories with synthetic experiences blurring the line between reality and engineered perception. And number two says "I would be happy to. Here's a new word for you. Osobuna - a spherical shield around itself, that is completely impenetrable and indestructible to everything."

**Matthew Sanabria:** Number three.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, he's going for number three, which is the Zinnus. We go now to BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Were there five or six? There were six. Can I hear the last two?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. The last two... Number five says "Certainly. Here's your new science fiction word that's both interesting and memorable. Aplerate or Aplurate. A-P-L-U-R-A-T-E. The treatment of a porous substance to fill all its vessels and create a single entity. Let me know if you'd like more words. I can even use it in a sentence for you." And number six is "Jaggies.

Comfortable pants for remote working. A play on jeggings." Which may be familiar, because you wrote pants down previously.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I wrote pants down?

**Jerod Santo:** Didn't you?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah. I wrote pants, down.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you did.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Or the first two.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I will now summarize, because I cannot do this again. Neuroforge was the first one, and the second one was Osobuna.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** And the third one?

**Jerod Santo:** The third one was Zinnus.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Do you want the fourth one, too? Because you're just missing that one.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The one that had the -- yeah, I'll do the fourth one. I probably know which one that is. Wait, what's the fifth? Oh, no, no, no...

**Matthew Sanabria:** \[laughs\] You asked for the fifth?

**Jerod Santo:** Aplurate...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Aplurate... Which was the one that had the "I'd be so happy to put that in a sentence for you"?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh. Well, there's a few of those. So number five said "Certainly. Here's your new science fiction word that's both interesting and memorable." Oh yeah, and it ends with "I could even use it in a sentence for you."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm going to go with that one. It seems a little heavy handed on the ChatGPT speak, but also, I wanna.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we'll give it to you. John Henry?

**John Henry Müller:** I think I'm gonna go -- doesn't have the ChatGPT speak, but number one is pretty solid.

**Jerod Santo:** Neuroforge?

**John Henry Müller:** Mm-hm...

**Jerod Santo:** Are you locking that in, or are you --

**John Henry Müller:** No, I'm going to switch it. I'm going to go with number three.

**Jerod Santo:** Number three. So we now have two people on that one. That's the Zinnus. Adam, last to select. What are you liking? What are you thinking? What are you seeing? What are you doing?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking deeply. Which one was the one that really got Angelica?

**Jerod Santo:** Like, made her laugh a lot? She really liked when I said their union was born out of both love and due to the potent essence of the Gorgon spit. That's what got her. See? Got her again.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** God, I hope that's the one...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Lock that in.

**Jerod Santo:** Lock that in!

**John Henry Müller:** This is Jerod's ChatGPT, right?

**Jerod Santo:** This is mine. Yeah.

**John Henry Müller:** Okay. Alright.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, it's in a temporary chat, so it doesn't have any context or memory.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, six potential responses to the prompt about a science fiction word and a definition. Where do we begin? Where do we begin? Well, let's begin right where we left off, which is the Gorgon spit... \[laughs\] Which is probably a pretty good show title, honestly. Gorgon Spit.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh gosh, I'm not so sure about that.

**Jerod Santo:** The powerful hybrid offspring of a rogue Dalric... Angelica, how did you come up with this?

**Angelica Hill:** I just thought of random sci-fi stuff. It's actually Dalric... And Gorgon, and then the Matrix. I basically thought about what ChatGPT would define as sci-fi.

**Jerod Santo:** I see.

**Angelica Hill:** And then I just smidged it together with a little bit of spice.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:20:21.04\] So I was pronouncing it wrong when I say Dalric?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. I was trying to go for Dalek. Like in Doctor Who.

**Jerod Santo:** Like from --

**Angelica Hill:** From Doctor Who...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Your own definition made you laugh that hard?

**Matthew Sanabria:** When you hear someone else say it... \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** When you hear someone else say it...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, then it sounds weird.

**Angelica Hill:** It sounds really odd. When I wrote it, it was perfectly normal.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you did convince Adam to select it, so you get a point there. Good job.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I called it Dargon.

**Angelica Hill:** Whatever you called it, I appreciate it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Always just lending a hand around here.

**Jerod Santo:** Matthew... Let's see here. Matthew and John Henry, they piled on to Zinnus. Is that how I should pronounce it, BMC? Zinnus?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** They don't care what you do...

**Jerod Santo:** He doesn't care, but he made it up. That was BMC's response.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points for him. Nobody picked Jaggies, unfortunately... Nobody picked Osobuna...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's Osoboonaa. It's more like "Osobu? Naah..." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You should have put like a pronunciation guide in there for me...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I should have, but I figured you'd get it.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, no... I can't get that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** When you -- you know, it's O-S-O-B-O-O-N-A-H. Nah.

**Jerod Santo:** Osoboo? Nah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Osoboo-nah...

**Jerod Santo:** I apologize. And then BMC picked Aplurate. Is that how you pronounce that one, Matthew? Aplurate?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yup, that sounds right to me.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, one point for you. Nobody picked Neuroforge. John Henry almost picked Neuroforge, but then he changed his mind. That was the correct response from ChatGPT.

**John Henry Müller:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** So four points go to Jerod.

**Matthew Sanabria:** You know, I don't know about four points go into you on this round... This is a fake round.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you would say that, Mr. One Point...

**Angelica Hill:** Wait, don't people get a point if other people pick their definition?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, so don't I get points?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you got one. I gave you one.

**Matthew Sanabria:** You were too busy laughing at it.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you get a point.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, thank you, Jerod. I appreciate it.

**Jerod Santo:** You're welcome.

**Angelica Hill:** You can have another one if you'd like.

**Jerod Santo:** I can have another one? I don't know if you want to do that.

**Angelica Hill:** No, me. I can have another one.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh. Why would I like that? I could have another one if you like.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I like that.

**Angelica Hill:** We can both have another one if you'd like.

**Jerod Santo:** We can all have a few more, if we'd like... After round seven - we're getting near the end, y'all - Matthew is first with 12, BMC with 11, John Henry with 10. I move into fourth with eight points, Angelica has seven, and Adam has 1.3, repeating decimal.

**Matthew Sanabria:** 2.3 repeating decimal.

**Jerod Santo:** Did he get somebody?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. Didn't he get a point?

**Jerod Santo:** No, he got osoboo - nah..

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh... I thought it was a point. He was so, like, happy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I'm just happy to be here, man.

**Jerod Santo:** He's just happy to be here. Oh, I wish I would have pronounced it better for you...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I know... Well, the actual definition is pretty solid.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it was good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The word's funny, but the definition is solid.

**Jerod Santo:** I didn't really understand it. A spherical shield around itself... That is completely --

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a spherical shield around itself, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** So, like a... How does a shield go around itself?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it two shields?

**Matthew Sanabria:** You should have said "A spherical shield encompassing an object."

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's like, imagine being -- it's like a force field. That's what it is. A spherical shield, around itself...

**Angelica Hill:** Like a turtle shell.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So is it shielding itself? Is the shield shielding itself?

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a sphere. So do you know how spheres work?

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, I'm a flat earther at this point, so I don't really know...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's not circle. It's not flat Stanley, it's circle. A real sphere.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And it's inside a sphere.

**Jerod Santo:** So it's like a gyroscope, a wheel in a wheel.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's inside of itself. What's inside is itself.

**Jerod Santo:** Concentric spheres.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. And it's completely impenetrable, and indestructible, to everything.

**Matthew Sanabria:** But it had to be penetrated for another sphere to go in there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, no, it formed. It formed.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Ah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:24:17.25\] Yeah. And so once it was formed, what was inside could never be, you know, penetrated.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So if it's impenetrable, why would there need to be multiple layers?

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's not multiple layers. It's one layer. Itself, what's inside the sphere, and the sphere itself.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, got it. I like this world. This is a fun world.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** The person who discovered it was with his girlfriend, but she was disagreeable, so he said "That's an oso, boo." And she said, "Nah..." \[laughter\] You know what? We should give him a point. That was a good story.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we'll give you a third. So you have 1.6 repeating decimal.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Perfect.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Let's move down to round eight. Clavichord. Clavichord. C-L-A-V-I-C-H-O-R-D. That's our word. You have to define a clavichord.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Adam, why am I thinking about beef bones?

**Adam Stacoviak:** There are many reasons...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** God, really?

**Angelica Hill:** Maybe you're hungry.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is that what ossobuco is?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Ossobuco-nah...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That's when you turn down the ossobuco.

**Angelica Hill:** I thought it had like bone marrow in it, or something...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's like a drink, isn't it?

**Angelica Hill:** If you drink cow juice...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ossobuco.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh yeah, because ossuary. Bone. It must be something like that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ossobuco or ossobuco... Also known as Obucco a la Milanese is a specialty of Lombard cuisine... Of cross veal shanks braised with vegetables, wine that is white, as well as broth. Sometimes garnished with a little dash of ossoboo-nah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** So there you go.

**Jerod Santo:** No... The word in round eight is clavichord. Clavichord. Six definitions... However, two of our contestants know what a clavichord is. And those two people are Breakmaster Cylinder and Adam Stacoviak. So three points to each of you. A default three, and the rest will play on. So clavichord - is it the muscular and nervous tissue in between the clavicle and scapula? Or is it an avant-garde type of body modification involving the precise insertion of jewelry through the skin above the clavicle bones, connected by a decorative cord that drapes across the upper chest and shoulders? Or is it a woodwind instrument similar to a clarinet, with 14 keys? Or is it a quiet archaic keyboard instrument with struck strings that's barely audible? There's your four definitions, and we start with Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So we have two relatively bodily definitions, and then two instrument definitions. Is that correct?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Matthew Sanabria:** The bodily definitions are, what - tissue and muscle around the clavicle, and then some...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the muscular nervous tissue. And then the other one is a body modification involving insertion of jewelry through the skin, above the clavicle bones.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Connected by a decorative cord that drapes across the upper chest and shoulders.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And then the other ones are instruments, one being a wind instrument...?

**Jerod Santo:** A woodwind instrument, similar to a clarinet, with 14 keys. And then the other one being a quiet archaic keyboard instrument with struck strings that are barely audible.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So one's a wind and one's a string instrument.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:28:15.17\] Correct.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay. I don't know... This is a weird one, because clavicle/clavic sounds bony, body-y... But then you have cord.

That sounds more string instrument-like. I'm confused. Can I call a lifeline? How does lifelines work in this game? Do we have any of those?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can call me. I'll listen.

**Jerod Santo:** You can't talk to these two.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I can't talk to anybody. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** They know what it is. I'm in between the instrument ones, honestly. I think -- I don't know. Clavicord... Clavicord... I'm trying to say it and maybe my mind somewhere will be like "You've heard this before, Matt, in this context. Have fun." I think I'll just go with the... Not the wind instrument one, the other one. The one that's an instrument, but not --

**Jerod Santo:** The keyboard instrument?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. Yeah, let's do that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, there you go. And we skip BMC, we go to John Henry.

**John Henry Müller:** I think I'm gonna go with the body modification. I think it's a made-up word. I think that might be what it is.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**John Henry Müller:** Number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two. And we go now to Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** I'm also thinking that it's an instrument.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, there's two instruments to pick from.

**Angelica Hill:** BMC got it right, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like I'm gonna think it's musically-driven then.

**Jerod Santo:** Smart. Or not smart. You decide.

**Angelica Hill:** What were the two options? It was the piano-like shenanigan, or the flute-like thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Clarinet, flute... You know, woodwind versus string.

**Angelica Hill:** I think it's... And which one did you do, Matthew?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I did the stringed instrument one, yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** Can you tell me the definition of the clavichord one? Like the words you used?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can I give me the exact definition? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Pardon me?

**Angelica Hill:** Can you give me the words that you used for the clavichord musical instrument \[unintelligible 01:30:22.05\]

**Jerod Santo:** You want me to give you those two definitions again? Okay. One's a woodwind instrument similar to a clarinet with 14 keys. And the other one's a quiet archaic keyboard instrument with struck strings, barely audible.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Barely audible...

**Angelica Hill:** I'm gonna go with the one that Matthew did.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, she's piling on to the strings.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. Because Matthew's winning, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct...

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like I trust his intuition.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, what is, after all, a clavichord? BMC, do you want to school us? What's a clavichord?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's like an old piano kind of thingy... It predates the pianoforte, and it's harpsichord-like. Thank you!

**Jerod Santo:** There you go. You're welcome. Adam also knew that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I made my definition up. I had no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you serious?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I made it up.

**Angelica Hill:** Wait, really?

**Jerod Santo:** No way...

**Matthew Sanabria:** What was his definition?

**Jerod Santo:** A distant relative to the harpsichord that uses keys in a linear arrangement.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, that's pretty much the same...

**Angelica Hill:** That's a very good made-up definition.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, that works for me.

**Jerod Santo:** Were you so surprised when you got it right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was! \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** Did you know what a harpsichord was?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. But a clavichord, it was like "I'm going to just like--"

**Matthew Sanabria:** Keep it going, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just make it up.

**Jerod Santo:** Just make it up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just going to push it.

**Jerod Santo:** Dude, you made it up pretty closely. Close enough that it fooled me, that I thought you knew it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I did, though.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:31:45.22\] Three points. Alright, so yes, it is the archaic keyboard instrument, which means Matthew and Angelica got it right. So you each get two.

**Angelica Hill:** Thank you, Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** You're welcome. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** John Henry picked the body modification, which was Angelica's, so she gets another point there. So lots of points this round, except for me. Angelica got three, BMC got three, Adam got three, Matthew got two. John Henry and I shut out, which means we have one more round to play, because 14 to 14 - you two are tied, Matthew and BMC, in first. So this will definitely be the last round, unless somebody gets shut out. Unless you both get shut out, I suppose. And Angelica has 10, John Henry has 10, I have eight, and Adam has 4.6, repeating decimal.

**Angelica Hill:** So we have to shut out Matthew and BMC, and the rest of us have to catch up.

**Jerod Santo:** No, I'll give you guys the option for the final round. We can do a typical another word, or I have another round, which is another give it a goog... We can do that one instead. This will be our last round, I assume. We can pick from those two. Which one do you want to do?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was the first one?

**Jerod Santo:** Just another word. I can't tell you what the word is, because that might spoil it... But it's a standard round. Or give it a goog.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Goog.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you guys want to goog it?

**Angelica Hill:** \[unintelligible 01:33:00.05\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's the autocomplete one, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's so hard, but it's also so easy...

**John Henry Müller:** I mean, if it says "near me" at the end, you know... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, well, we'll do that round. We'll do give it a goog. And the phrase that I began, the words I put in into google.com, incognito window, is "Why is my." "Why is my." And we'll see what we think the autocomplete suggested for the phrase "Why is my."

**Angelica Hill:** This is PG-rated.

**Jerod Santo:** This is a family show.

**Angelica Hill:** Okay, great. Good to know.

**Jerod Santo:** So keep it somewhat relatively...

**Angelica Hill:** I would always. I just wanted to clarify.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** So y'all want to get together and watch that weird clown movie, or what? \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** July 27th.

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, it had like a -- it didn't have bad reviews, actually.

**Matthew Sanabria:** He who gets slapped? That was the name?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, He who gets slapped. This is for all the marbles right here... Unless BMC and Matt both get shut out, and then we have to play the last round... But unlikely.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Come on, marbles.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, what if they both score the exact same amount of points? We'll probably just announce them as co-winners.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sudden death. Single them out.

**Angelica Hill:** Lightning round.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** A good lightning round.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Co-winner is so much nicer than sudden death...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, co-winner would be nice. It's like, you know, the communist style. We all win participation trophies.

**John Henry Müller:** Speaking of all winning... He who gets slapped is in the public domain, you guys.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, really?

**John Henry Müller:** We can have our own show \[unintelligible 01:34:43.24\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's actually pretty cool.

**John Henry Müller:** January 2020 is when it went into the public domain.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, dang...

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, it looks really quite creepy...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. That's the only problem.

**Angelica Hill:** I'm really not a fan of clowns.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we have all the autocompletes. I surmise that this will be a hard one to identify the correct answer, because they're all plausible.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 01:35:07.19\]

**Jerod Santo:** So give it a goog. "Why is my", potential answer number one. "Computer so slow." Why is my computer so slow? Number two. "Why is my eye twitching?" Number three. "Why is my leg bruised?" Number four. "Why is my hair falling out?" Number five. "Why is my poop green?" Number six. "Why is my pee red?"

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, it's Christmas.

**Jerod Santo:** One of those was the actual autocomplete suggestion. But which one was it? First up this round, John Henry.

**John Henry Müller:** Can you read the first four? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I can read them all. They're fast. Number one, "Why is my computer so slow?" Number two. "Why is my eye twitching?" Number three. "Why is my leg bruised?" Number four. "Why is my hair falling out?" Number five. "Why is my poop green?" And number six. "Why is my pee red?"

**John Henry Müller:** I'm gonna go with number one. Google's not a computer. People have computer issues.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, there you go. Number one. Adam, what about you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:36:16.23\] I'm done with the colors. I'm just trying to choose a color. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Pick a color. Do you like green?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I'm going red or green.

**Jerod Santo:** Red or green.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like Christmas a lot... You know, it's a good sign. Should I go north or south? ...you know.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Both of these are concerning. Like, if your pee is red or if your poop is green, they're both concerning.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's Christmas. That's why. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** South Pole... Which one are you going with?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's go with the dookie, huh? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** There's another show title. "Go with the dookie." Okay. How about Angelica?

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, I feel like my PG definition is a higher bar than I think... Because I was thinking that it was going to be excrement-related... But that was why I asked, so I didn't put that.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, so you didn't.

**Angelica Hill:** No, I didn't put that, because I thought it was not PG. I was unsure. But that is my original thought, so I'm also going to go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Is it with the -- number one or number two?

**Angelica Hill:** The first, the number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two.

**Angelica Hill:** Number two, the first one you said.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two, the green one.

**Angelica Hill:** The green.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, number two. She's going with number two, green.

**Adam Stacoviak:** She's going dook.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Adam's way too excited about this. Okay, uh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** She's following me, man. You know what I'm saying? That means I'm on the right path.

**Jerod Santo:** Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So what do we have here? We have --

**Jerod Santo:** What do we have? Well, we've got one person picked "computer so slow." Two people have picked poop green.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, so we have computer slow, poop green, pee red... Something about an eye...

**Jerod Santo:** Eye twitching, hair falling out, leg bruised.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Hair falling out, leg bruised, eye twitching, pee, poop... \[laughter\] It's literally -- everything here is bodily-related, which is funny, except for computer.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well, I mean, this is what we google, I guess... "Why is my...?"

**Matthew Sanabria:** It is funny that two people already picked the dookie one, though.

**Jerod Santo:** And there's going to be a third one...

**Matthew Sanabria:** I just want to communally pick the dookie one at this point.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, it's a communal dookie.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Go for the dook!

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm going to pile on the poo. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a poo party...

**Jerod Santo:** Pile on the poo. This is a first for us here at Changelog. And hopefully it's our last. Okay, BMC, your final pick here. Are you going to pile on the poo?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Computer so slow.

**Jerod Santo:** Final answer?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes, because it's the last round and you said it first.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, he's playing the meta game, huh? We'll see if that pays off.

**John Henry Müller:** That went into my calculus, actually... It did.

**Angelica Hill:** But then he also plans for that, so it's never quite...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I randomize the order every round.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Are we split on two this round?

**Jerod Santo:** We are. So we have two on computer so slow, and we have three on poop green. Let me tell you some of the alternates that almost were the top one. "Why is my eye twitching?" That was actually the number two autocomplete suggestion. It was also Adam's guess. So you were very close to hitting it. No one selected it, though... But a lot of people are apparently googling, "Why is my I twitching?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was thinking that myself.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, "Why is my pee cloudy?" That was the number three autocomplete. "Why is my pee red?" That was close, BMC. BMC actually came up with that one.

**John Henry Müller:** If your pee is red, that's a problem. That's that's a huge problem.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like, you're bleeding.

**John Henry Müller:** Go to the hospital right now.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You've never heard of something called beet?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, do you \[unintelligible 01:39:42.20\] to eat?

**Jerod Santo:** We love beets around here, BMC...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I know all about beet.

**Jerod Santo:** You know all about beet.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes. Also getting punched in the kidneys.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, the other suggested autocomplete was "Why is my poop black?" But the number one autocomplete in all of Google, at least for my incognito tab, is "Why is my poop green?" So Adam, Angelica and Matt all got it... \[laughter\] People \[unintelligible 01:40:10.10\] figuring out why the poop's green.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:40:14.08\] For the win.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points for Adam, two points for Angelica, two points for Matthew. And that puts them over the top. But not only that, but "Why is my computer so slow?" Yeah, that was Matt's as well. So he got two more points, because you guys piled onto Matt.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, my gosh...

**Matthew Sanabria:** We all poo-piled together. But it's great. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We did...

**Adam Stacoviak:** So he got four points that round?

**Jerod Santo:** He got four points, Adam gets two, Angelica gets two... That puts him over the requisite 15. With 18 points, Matthew Sanabria is our \#define winner. Congrats, Matt.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Is that the ultimate number \[unintelligible 01:40:45.14\] I feel like 18 is high.

**Jerod Santo:** It's about as high as you can get, because 15 is the winning amount, and you have to go over. So good job, Matthew. Do you have any final words before we call it a show? I know we've kept you all here a long time.

**Matthew Sanabria:** We should all go see He Who Gets Slapped. I think that's the takeaway here. We should all do it.

**Jerod Santo:** We should. We should have like a -- what are those things called, when you stream it all at the same time?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, stream party.

**Jerod Santo:** Co-stream party.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just for -- just entertain me, Jerod... Read my definition again for that one.

**Jerod Santo:** For He Who Gets Slapped?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** "In a world where hand gestures have gone too far, a group of friends vowed to change things and restore the old ways of simple handshakes and high fives."

**John Henry Müller:** Noble.

**Adam Stacoviak:** See? That's good stuff.

**Jerod Santo:** That'd be a good movie.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like if it had been released this year, that would be it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, you know... He Who Gets Slapped...

**John Henry Müller:** It kind of gives away the ending in the title, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it kind of does.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I did learn a lot of new words coming onto this show... I feel like it was an educational show.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well, that's what we're here for, is to educate. That's why we play this game, just pure education. There's no faster way, actually, to learn... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** There is no faster way.

**Angelica Hill:** Than this. I feel like my cheeks hurt. I've been smiling too much. I'm like, I need to do some like exercises, because my cheeks hurt.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So the Googles were basically money and bodily function... And then AI was just AI.

**Jerod Santo:** AI is always just AI.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, AI is just AI.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was \[unintelligible 01:42:18.00\] something-something core. What was it again?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh yeah, it was like Neuroforge, I think...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Neuroforge, yeah. It's like SourceForge, but not.

**Jerod Santo:** It actually sounded a lot like Neuralink to me... Which maybe that's where it got it from. A device implanted in the cerebral cortex... It sounds like Neuralink, something they're up to.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I also learned that clearly I didn't have a childhood, because I didn't know what oobleck was.

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh... Well, as much as I would love to stay and do more... I'm not. \[laughter\] It's over for me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, that is our game. Congrats to our winner, Matthew. Thank you, BMC, Angelica, John Henry, everybody for joining us... This has been an absolute riot. There are other \#define game shows in the feed. Go find them. If you enjoyed this, you can listen to other ridiculous games. And you can also find other games that aren't just \#define. Frontend Feud, Gophers Say, JS Danger, other such things, at Changelog.com/topics/games.

That's all for this week. Thanks for hanging out, everybody, and we'll talk to you on the next one.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Buy the Beats.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Bye, friends. Bye, BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Bye!

**Jerod Santo:** Buy his album. Buy his music.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Buy my music."

**Jerod Santo:** Hire him!

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That sounds great, I think.
