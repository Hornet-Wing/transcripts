**Jerod Santo:** Welcome to \#define, our 100% original and in no way copied from Balderdash game show, where you're rewarded for lying, like a skilled politician. Let's introduce our players, in the order they will be playing. First up - yes, it's Amal Hussein. She's back.

**Amal Hussein:** Again? I'm first against again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right... \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** This is like the worst way to tell someone that they're going first. We have a whole pre-gaming for a reason.

**Jerod Santo:** This is how I assert my dominance early in the day, as I just put you first...

**Amal Hussein:** I can see that.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and now we know the order of operations. Playing second - it's the winner of our inaugural game, it's Lars Wikman. Hey, Lars.

**Lars Wikman:** Hello, hello. Pleasure to be back. I have no expectation to win this time...

**Jerod Santo:** Did you sense the spite in my voice when I had to announce you? Because I was so close... I was so close to winning the previous round.

**Lars Wikman:** You were also close to scheduling me out... But Emma fixed it for us.

**Jerod Santo:** True. Unfortunately, you showed up anyways. Okay, so next up --

**Amal Hussein:** Do we have two Swedes on the show right now? Is that what's going on here?

**Jerod Santo:** Hold on, we haven't introduced Emma yet. You can't just start talking her.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay. Sorry. You're right, you're right. She doesn't exist yet.

**Lars Wikman:** Hasn't been defined yet.

**Amal Hussein:** Yes, exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** It's Taylor Troesh, livestreaming from his friend's bedroom... What's up, Taylor?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yo, how's it going? Here in the friend's bedroom once again... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** He's back in his friend's bedroom... Always happy to have you on the show. Playing fourth - there she is; now you can talk to her. It's our new contestant and our old friend, Emma Bostian. Hey, Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Hey... Or hej, I guess they'd say Swedish, which sounds exactly the same. I'm not Swedish, but I'd like to be someday if they'll keep me.

**Jerod Santo:** When you get older, yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good goals.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, you're a Swede in transition, I would say...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, how's your lying?

**Emma Bostian:** I mean, I've made it this far in life...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so you're doing alright.

**Emma Bostian:** There's a reason I'm on this show...

**Jerod Santo:** We invited Emma for a few reasons. First of all, excellent BS-er. Secondly, the creator of our game show genre when she introduced JavaScript Jeopardy years ago on JS Party... Which I then took and ran with, and we have a bevy of game shows now... So happy to have you, Emma. You're welcome back anytime. Finally, playing last, because I'm enforcing his chivalrous ways... It's my partner in crime, it's Adams Stacoviak. What's up, dude?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's up?! Glad to be back, glad to lie to you all, all day long.

**Jerod Santo:** Especially Amal. You're very good at trickin' Amal.

**Adam Stacoviak:** She's gonna get all my definitions, just love them and gobble them up.

**Amal Hussein:** Pretty much, yeah. But you know what? I would say the same for Lars. We didn't talk about that enough, but Lars definitely fell for me quite a bit, so... You know?

**Lars Wikman:** Who could avoid it...?

**Amal Hussein:** Ah... This is not good. This is a tactic; suck up to your opponents, get them comfortable...

**Lars Wikman:** Well, I need to build a good chemistry here, because we need to make sure that Jerod does not win. That's very critical to me winning.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Allyship is part of the game.

**Jerod Santo:** I am here to be the antagonist, so that all of you can be friends, even though if you think critically, you're also playing against yourselves... But whatever, whatever. This is a game of fake definitions. Here's how it works. Each round has a word; I will present said word. It also has a definition. You all will create fake definitions that represent that word. All words in the category of STEM. If you actually know what the word means, you can submit that to me, and you'll get three points for being correct. If you don't know what it means, then you'll make up a definition and try to trick the opponents into guessing yours. Three points for the correct definition to start, two points if you guessed the right one at the end, one point for each person who chooses your definition. If none of you - there are five this time, but if none of you select the correct definition, then three points to me as your host and moderator. The first player to reach 12 points wins. Any questions before we kick into round one?

**Lars Wikman:** If I did the math right, this means that you could, if you craft really believable ones, actually beat someone who is consistently correct. Or you could draw with someone who's consistently correct, which I like as an idea.

**Jerod Santo:** This is true.

**Amal Hussein:** You say the first person who wins 12 rounds, or 12 points?

**Jerod Santo:** 12 points.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, wow. Okay, so I guess that's how difficult it was for us to get there... I thought we got really close last time.

**Jerod Santo:** So last game we played 10 rounds, and Lars made it to 17 points... So we're thinking that it might be seven to eight rounds, maybe... But we'll see. We'll see how the game plays out. It just depends. So we hop right into round one. Your first word is syzygy.

**Amal Hussein:** And these are still STEM?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. All in the world of STEM. Please submit to me your fake definitions privately now. Or whenever you're ready.

**Amal Hussein:** Can you spell the word for us, or put it in chat?

**Jerod Santo:** \[05:56\] Yes, it's syzygy. I will put it in the chat here. I am resolved this time not to fall prey to the humble megaflask. Please don't use megaflask in any of your definitions.

**Emma Bostian:** If you can hear some kind of farm animal noise coming out of my microphones...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Is that your daughter?

**Emma Bostian:** ...it's my crotch goblin, who does not enjoy putting her pajamas on.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it sounds like she's having fun.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's why you need to go to a friend's house.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Crotch goblin... \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] No, I love her. I'm just facetious.

**Lars Wikman:** Most kids around that age are some kind of goblins, but different times.

**Emma Bostian:** Mm-hm... Indeed.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, but two to four is the perfect age for children. They're the cutest, they're the weirdest... They say the darndest things.

**Lars Wikman:** Do you still have any in that range, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** No, my youngest is five now... Unfortunately. I mean it's not unfortunate that she's five, but... I'm happy that she continues to get older, I guess. Although my first daughter, I made her promise that she'd stay three forever, and she actually fell for it, and now I just punish her constantly for lying to me. \[laughter\] "You said you're gonna be three, and now look at you! You're 15!" I mean, that's such a terrible lie. Such a disappointment. Alright, I have Amal's...

**Amal Hussein:** You have a wide range of children, Jerod... Dealing with emotionally demanding and physically demanding - like, that's a wide spread. That's impressive. And then you have to deal with us, adult children on the show...

**Jerod Santo:** Right, yes. My other --

**Amal Hussein:** Your other bambinos.

**Jerod Santo:** My other crotch goblins... \[laughter\] I have Emma's... So far the ladies whoopin' up on the guys in time to definition...

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, you don't have to state the obvious, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** TTD... These girls know how to TTD, time to definition. Okay, I've got Lars, and Taylor... And Adam is now going up the rear.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Greatness takes time.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Greatness takes time.

**Lars Wikman:** Something-something blockchain...?

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, exactly. Something-something NFT.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. I wish, though...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Jerod, hold it together... You have to read these...

**Amal Hussein:** Something-something please click this link...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we have all six definitions. I can't look at you guys, I'll have to... I had to go fullscreen on my spreadsheet, because if I look at your faces, there's just no way I can read these out loud without cracking. Syzygy - a phenomenon that occurs when a proton and an electron collide; named after scientists Thomas Syzygy. A phenomenon in literary psychology where the fiction lies to the reader as part of characters in the story not knowing the truth. Syzygy - maximum axial tilt of a planetary body. The persistent distributed key-value data store associated with the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Who was that?!

**Amal Hussein:** I couldn't even keep a straight face.

**Jerod Santo:** Syzygy - the fizzing that occurs after extracting two or more elements from their original state... Or syzygy, an alignment of three celestial bodies. We will start with Amal. I can reread or I can help you remember if you need to, which of those six definitions is the correct one for syzygy?

**Amal Hussein:** \[10:09\] I hate going first. Well, that was interesting... There was two references to planets. One sounded more legit than the other, but the element thing looked good, the proton thing seemed very legit, too... Can you read the planet once again?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. This was number three, the maximum axial tilt of a planetary body.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, I'm gonna go with that.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Lars, your turn.

**Lars Wikman:** What was the proton thing?

**Jerod Santo:** A phenomenon that occurs when a proton and an electron collide. Named after scientist Thomas Syzygy.

**Lars Wikman:** Sure. Let's go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Taylor, your turn.

**Taylor Troesh:** Let's go for the spread. Let's go for that other heavenly body one. Heavenly body, celestial body...

**Jerod Santo:** An alignment of three celestial bodies?

**Amal Hussein:** It's a little early to be playing the spread, but go for it. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You can't start too soon. Okay. Emma, what do you think?

**Emma Bostian:** What are we left with?

**Jerod Santo:** We're left with -- so unused is the literary psychology one, and the...

**Lars Wikman:** IBM Kubernetes one...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the Kubernetes service and the fizzing that occurs after extracting two or more elements. So those three.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, I'll go with the most sciency one, the fizzing that occurs...

**Amal Hussein:** That's what I would have picked too, for what it's worth...

**Jerod Santo:** That leaves... Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh... What was number four, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** Number four was the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service... \[laughs\] Sorry.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's go with that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. \[laughter\] Very good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That sounds legit...

**Amal Hussein:** You're a martyr, if I ever knew one, Adam...

**Jerod Santo:** He is playing the spread, man... He's just playing the spread.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. We will see.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, let's start with that one. So Adam thought that Syzygy was the persistent distributed key-value data store associated with the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service. That was Emma's definition. So one point for Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** It was so bad. I was gauging how strong all of your answers would be.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you got a point out of it, so not too bad.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, congrats.

**Jerod Santo:** Speaking of Emma, she guessed that says syzygy was the fizzing that occurs after extracting two or more elements... That was Adam's, so you guys traded points there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And Amal, you admitted you would have guessed it! You love my definitions! You love my definitions. \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** I was so close to guessing that; honestly, it's true. If you want to make me a T-shirt that says "I love Adam's definitions", I'll wear it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'll make it.

**Jerod Santo:** That would be a good one.

**Amal Hussein:** Do it.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, this time around, Amal, you chose the maximum axial tilt of a planetary body. Not Adam's. That was Taylor's definition. So one point for Taylor.

**Amal Hussein:** Darn it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good one.

**Amal Hussein:** Good job, Taylor.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor guessed the other planetary one, which was an alignment of three celestial bodies... That was the correct definition, so Taylor got it right. He was close with his maximum axial tilt. So two points for him, plus one. Meanwhile, Lars, you guessed a phenomenon that occurs when a proton and electron collide. That was Amal's, so she gets one point there.

**Amal Hussein:** Basically, you're on-brand, Lars. You're just picking my answers...

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah...

**Emma Bostian:** I need to know why Adam chose mine, because mine was complete BS. Like, that was not even --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because it was BS.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. Well, thank you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So he just likes to see the world burn, or what?

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because it was BS, that's why. It's fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, that round goes to Taylor. He gets three points; two for getting it correct, and one for tricking Amal. Emma and Adam both scored, Amal scored... Our previous winner is sitting in last with zero. I also have zero, so... Off to a hot start. Let's move to round two. Our word for round two is Ultracrepidarian. Ultracrepidarian. I will put it in the chat.

**Taylor Troesh:** Hey Jerod, may I have the country of origin?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Lars Wikman:** For the word?

**Amal Hussein:** \[14:10\] This is not a spelling bee.

**Jerod Santo:** It's not a spelling bee. Alright. The word is in the chat. The word is Ultracrepidarian. Spelled, for our listeners, it's spelled Ultracrepidarian. Ultracrepidarian.

**Amal Hussein:** I almost sent my answer to Jason, our editor... It would have been like so random.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. He'd be like "What is this...?!"

**Amal Hussein:** Qu'est que ça?

**Lars Wikman:** "What did you call me?!"

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, exactly.

**Lars Wikman:** "Ultracrepidarian...!"

**Amal Hussein:** Listen, just because I watch the Kardashians doesn't mean -- I'm just kidding...

**Taylor Troesh:** Wait, what is a darian? Because if we're talking about ultra-creepy darians... Do you know of someone?

**Jerod Santo:** You can't phone a friend.

**Taylor Troesh:** You can't bring one on the show.

**Jerod Santo:** That's someone who's always daring you to do stuff...

**Taylor Troesh:** But in a really crappy way.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you know, they'll double-dog dare you, they'll triple-dog dare you... Taylor's in.

**Taylor Troesh:** I think we're all very comfortable pretending like we know what we're talking about... But sounding official in STEM is a little bit different.

**Jerod Santo:** It is hard, isn't it? I feel like Adam might be waiting for ChatGPT to respond. He's been slow lately.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Yeah, he does look like he's -- he's typing to ChatGPT "Please be terse and short."

**Lars Wikman:** "Make up a definition for this word that you might actually have in your dictionary..."

**Amal Hussein:** "I need to be able to tweet it! This many characters", you know?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm known to be an LLM, so there you go...

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Oh my God, imagine -- we should train an LLM on just Changelog. That would be so fun.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There is one.

**Jerod Santo:** We have one that has been fine-tuned with our transcripts.

**Amal Hussein:** Why do I not know this? This is amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you can ask yourself questions. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can talk to you.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I have all six definitions. Are we ready? Number one, Ultracrepidarian - a person who gives opinions beyond their area of expertise, occasionally used in academic contexts. Number two, a ferocious beast from the Crepidarian period; was long believed to be the precursor in the evolutionary spectrum to the famous Tyrannosaurus Rex. Number three, the paramount operation within a set of mathematical combinatorics. Number four, a person who can read two pages at once. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Amal, stop. You can't just laugh in the middle of my readings. I'm trying to keep a straight face over here.

**Adam Stacoviak:** She can't, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** She does. I need to like mute --

**Adam Stacoviak:** She should not.

**Jerod Santo:** I should just mute you guys...

**Amal Hussein:** Listen, we should never use the word should, okay? Let's just put it that way.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number five, Ultracrepidarian - a genus of sea urchins that were once thought to be unable to move. Don't laugh, Amal. It has since been confirmed that they simply move very slowly. And last, number six - mammals which only attack their prey when they are sleeping. So there you have it. Six definitions for Ultracrepidarian. Can we identify which one is the actual definition? Lars, you are first.

**Lars Wikman:** Am I supposed to remember all of these?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You can ask for -- I can help you out.

**Lars Wikman:** Can you give me the mathy one again? Combinatoric something-something.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. The paramount operation within a set of mathematical combinatorics. That's a hard word to say.

**Amal Hussein:** Just remember we have somebody who studied math on the panel... Including myself, technically, but... I mean, Taylor, I think, is a little more advanced...

**Lars Wikman:** \[18:04\] I saw him laugh a lot at a different one... So I think he \[unintelligible 00:18:07.10\] on that one.

**Jerod Santo:** See, Lars plays the -- he reads our faces the entire time that we're reading these... Don't you? Yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** He does. It smart. It's a good move.

**Lars Wikman:** I like faces... And then there was one about Academic context... Being a smartass.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, a person who gives opinions beyond their area of expertise, occasionally used in academic contexts.

**Lars Wikman:** No, I think that one was inspired by our conversation earlier. Let's go with the combinatorics one. I think someone's just trying to be fancy, but I'll go with the mathy one, because none of them really worked for me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What number is that one?

**Jerod Santo:** That's number three. So Lars went for number three, the math one. Let's go to Taylor now.

**Emma Bostian:** Creepy-sleepy.

**Lars Wikman:** That one is genuinely creepy.

**Taylor Troesh:** Creepy-sleepy, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you talking about the sea urchins?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, the thing while you sleep. Yeah, the last one. Creepy-sleepy.

**Jerod Santo:** Mammals which only attack their prey while they're sleeping?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, creepy sleepy.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. I didn't know that. I guess you're right. Yes. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Creepy-sleepy.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor. Good, goes for that one. Now we have Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** What were the first two, again?

**Jerod Santo:** The first two was the person who gives opinions beyond their area of expertise, and the second one was the ferocious beast from the Crepidarian period.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna go with number one.

**Jerod Santo:** Alrighty. We go to Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Pressure's on... Let's see here. Two and five, please. Give me those back.

**Jerod Santo:** Two was the ferocious beast from the Crepidarian period. Do you want the whole thing, or is that good enough?

**Adam Stacoviak:** End to end, please.

**Jerod Santo:** From the Crepdiarian period... It was long believed to be the precursor in the evolutionary spectrum to the famous Tyrannosaurus Rex. Number five was a genus of sea urchins that were once thought to be unable to move. It has since been confirmed that they simply move very slowly. That's five.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm doubling up with Taylor. I'm going with six. I feel like the creepy-sleepy is the most on the money.

**Jerod Santo:** The mammal which only attack their prey when they're sleeping?

**Emma Bostian:** Wait, are we allowed to choose the same as someone else?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I'm piling on six.

**Emma Bostian:** Cool.

**Jerod Santo:** The reason why people spread is to lock me out of points... Because if no one gets it right, I get points, and so that's why you want to spread your answers... But you do not have to. So now we go to Amal. Last up, Amal.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I have conviction though.

**Jerod Santo:** He's got conviction.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm gonna play the spread a little bit. I would have gone with the mammals one, the creepy-sleepy thing, but I think the sea urchins one sounds so ridiculous that I don't think anyone here has made it up. So...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so Amal goes for the sea urchins. That's number five. Yes.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on... Is this another Adam answer? Because if it is, then I don't want to pick this.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, \[unintelligible 00:20:51.00\] I think you should choose it, because it's mine...

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want to change it? \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** I don't remember the numbers of answers unless they're mine, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, Adam works around numbers.

**Amal Hussein:** That's a tell. Okay, fine. Fine.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Don't choose mine.

**Amal Hussein:** Sea urchin. Sea urchin. Let's do it. And if it's yours, Adam, this is 00 yeah, we're officially starting a war if this is yours.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, let's find out right away. So Amal thought perhaps Ultracrepidarian was a genus of sea urchins... And maybe Adam wrote that. But no, Lars wrote that. So one point for Lars.

**Lars Wikman:** Thank you...

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, that was so good, Lars.

**Jerod Santo:** He almost lost his point there, because we almost talked Amal out of doing it, and he would have lost that point.

**Amal Hussein:** Well, no, because Adam basically fronted like it was his, so... Man, tricky, tricky, tricky... It's fine. The war is not on. I mean, the war has been delayed, so that's all that matters.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Still on.

**Jerod Santo:** Lars thought that Ultracrepidarian was the paramount operation within a set of mathematical combinatorics. Tough to spit that one out. That was Emma's definition. Good job, Emma.

**Lars Wikman:** That was a good definition. Saying that I thought it was that is stating it strongly, but... Yes. I did pick that one.

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah... You did say it could be someone BS-ing, so...

**Taylor Troesh:** You should have gone for the one that Emma did. I'm pretty sure that was the right one.

**Amal Hussein:** \[22:11\] \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** You should have gone for the other one.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor thinks he should have picked Emma's, which was a person who gives opinions beyond their area of expertise... And he should have, because that's the correct answer. That is what an Ultracrepidarian is.

**Amal Hussein:** No way...! Did anybody pick that one?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, me.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Emma got it.

**Amal Hussein:** You did? Oh, awesome. Good job, Emma!

**Emma Bostian:** Thanks!

**Jerod Santo:** So three total points for Emma this round. But we're not done yet, because who picked that creepy-sleepy...? Taylor and Adam both fell for Amal's definition. Two points for Amal!

**Amal Hussein:** Ha-ha! I win! Yes! \[laughter\] Winner of the day.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No...!

**Emma Bostian:** That was a good one, though.

**Amal Hussein:** They even like remixed it and called it creepy-sleepy. I mean, honestly, I should get double points for that.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we'll just give you the correct amount of points, but...

**Amal Hussein:** They came up with their own definition of my definition.

**Jerod Santo:** They did. So much so that it confused me.

**Taylor Troesh:** I actually knew the answer for this one, but I really wanted to say creepy-sleepy... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well-played... I mean, poorly-played, but well-played on another \[unintelligible 00:23:22.07\]

**Lars Wikman:** Wait, you knew the definition, but you didn't give it to Jerod?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, I knew this one. I just wanted to say creepy-sleepy. \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Listen, Taylor's not a capitalist like all of us, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** No, he's an anarchist.

**Amal Hussein:** He's here to have fun, not here to win. Okay?

**Jerod Santo:** So did you know it after I read it to you then? Because you didn't submit it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, yeah. I knew -- when you said it, I was like "Oh, yeah, that's it."

**Jerod Santo:** Once I read it. Yeah. Alright, after two rounds we have Emma in first place, with four points, we have Amal and Taylor in second with three, Lars and Adam tied in last, with one; I guess technically I'm last with zero, but we don't have to talk about that.

**Break:** \[24:05\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's move now to round three, and Omphaloskepsis. Omphaloskepsis. Please submit to me Omphaloskepsis now. Or whenever you're ready. I'm actually gonna go get a drink of water and bring it back, so take your time... Take your time, I'll be right back.

**Amal Hussein:** Take all the time you need. This one's hard.

**Jerod Santo:** Don't talk about me while I'm gone.

**Amal Hussein:** Hey you guys, we're doing great, because Jerod is at zero points, and we're already on round three. I just want to say, great job, everyone. Keep going strong, okay? He can't win this, or even come close.

**Emma Bostian:** This is much more difficult after a full day of work.

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah, they have it easy. It's good to have someone else in the timezone.

**Emma Bostian:** Exactly. Us Europeans have to \[unintelligible 00:30:26.28\] I say that as if I've completely just abandoned my US American identity... Which, frankly, I have...

**Amal Hussein:** Now all you have to do is work on the accent, Emma, and then you'll be good. You've already got like a half-Swedish baby...

**Lars Wikman:** Honestly, I would say, it seems like you're pretty far along with the accent.

**Emma Bostian:** \[unintelligible 00:30:46.20\]

**Lars Wikman:** Firstly, I actually heard it as a bit of a Norwegian accent, which is not bad, because those sound so happy.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it's I'm learning it from preschool. My daughter's in Swedish pre-school and I'm just picking it up from her. So...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I have all six definitions for Omphaloskepsis. Are we ready? Okay, number one, a symptom of the lymph nodes where they react to and reject a substance the body has consumed; usually accompanied by significant discomfort and irritation of the mucous membranes. Number two, a process in theoretical immunology whereby the functions of cells within the immune system attack one another. Number three, also known as wigglebone disease... \[laughter\] An infection of the cartilage protrusion on the tip of the nose.

**Amal Hussein:** On the tip of the nose. Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Number four - a form of scoliosis, where the deterioration of the spine occurs because of inflammation of the spinal fluid. Number five, the contemplation of one's navel. \[laughter\] Sorry. The contemplation of one's navel as an aid to meditation. And number six, similar to facial myalgia, Omphaloskepsis is an infection of the skin inside the nostrils.

**Emma Bostian:** How did we get two nose ones?

**Jerod Santo:** So lots of medical definitions here... We have six of them, read at various qualities of reading... And we have Taylor up first. What, sir, do you think Omphaloskepsis means?

**Taylor Troesh:** I think the two nose ones sound like they were written by extremely intelligent people, so I will go -- \[laughter\] I will go with the skin one, and not the wigglebone disease.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so Taylor picks number six. An infection of the skin inside the nostrils. We go to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm going with number one. That thing about the lymph nodes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Emma picks lymph nodes. We go to Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm thinking three or five... What's three again? No, sorry, two or four. Two or four.

**Jerod Santo:** Two was the process in theoretical immunology whereby the functions of cells within the immune system attack one another. And four was a form of scoliosis where the deterioration of the spine occurs because of inflammation in the spinal fluid.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's go with that one. Number four.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, number four goes to Adam. Back to Amal now...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, the fluid thing sounds really good... But the first one I think really hooked me in.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You're gonna pile on with Emma on number one?

**Emma Bostian:** Well, do you see I'm in the lead there, Adam?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] She has a point...

**Amal Hussein:** The scoliosis thing makes sense, because it's like --

**Jerod Santo:** Scoliosis is number four. Adam picked that one. Number one is the symptom of the lymph nodes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's true.

**Amal Hussein:** So Adam, do you want me to join you with team scoliosis?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nah... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** \[33:58\] Okay, I'm gonna go with my girl Emma.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so you're on lymph nodes as well.

**Amal Hussein:** Mm-hm.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a bad move.

**Amal Hussein:** Do we split the points if we both are correct?

**Jerod Santo:** You both score them, yes. You don't split them, you score them.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, that's good. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** And Lars... Lars but not least...

**Lars Wikman:** It's between immunology and the spinal fluid... But I'll go with immunology; get a bit more spread.

**Jerod Santo:** A process in theoretical immunology?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. That's number two. Lars.

**Amal Hussein:** That one sounded very fake, Lars. I'm surprised you picked that out there. I just wanna put that out there. Shots fired...

**Taylor Troesh:** I'll go with that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No one got the real definition.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's find out where the ladies landed. They both picked lymph nodes, and Lars was smiling all ears when you did that. Two points for him. That was his definition.

**Amal Hussein:** Lars...!

**Emma Bostian:** Sorry, Amal. I was only a bio major for three months, so...

**Amal Hussein:** For three months? Okay.

**Taylor Troesh:** What was the word again?

**Jerod Santo:** Omphaloskepsis.

**Amal Hussein:** Oompa Loompa.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, well, isn't that the chocolate river in Willy Wonka, the Oompa Loompa sepsis? \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** I was like, they were the little baby dancers.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah... Let's check out scoliosis. Adam liked to check that one out, and Amal checked that one in. That was her definition. Adam, you're loving Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, Adam...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It was a good one. The tables are turning!

**Amal Hussein:** I tried to get Lars to come my way, but you know... Now I have to pick a different tactic. I can't comment on my answers. That's like -- it's already out. So just so you know, when I'm commenting on other answers, it's not mine. Just so you know.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Actually playing reverse psychology on you...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Sorry. Just so you know.

**Jerod Santo:** Lars like a process in theoretical immunology... Amal said that sounded really fake. It turns out it was really fake. Emma made that one up.

**Amal Hussein:** Good job, Emma. Yay!

**Lars Wikman:** Figures...

**Emma Bostian:** Two in a row, Lars. I'm coming for you.

**Jerod Santo:** Now the question is, can Taylor play the spread to much effect? Because he's the last one left to keep me out of the points... And he picked similar to facial myalgia - Omphaloskepsis is an infection of the skin inside the nostrils... Adam, was that one right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nah.

**Jerod Santo:** No, that was Adam's. One point for Adam, which means nobody landed on the correct definition... The contemplation of one's navel as an aid to meditation. Woo-hoo!

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Are you serious? Was that real?

**Jerod Santo:** That's real.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ohm my gosh...

**Amal Hussein:** What?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

**Emma Bostian:** Everything I know is a lie...

**Amal Hussein:** You can't pick ridiculous definitions, okay? That's not part of the game. Because we make up the ridiculous ones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's kind of part of it...

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, darn it!

**Jerod Santo:** See, now I've thrown a wrench in your plans. It turns out when I laugh at the definition it's not necessarily because it's wrong... It's just because it's funny.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, look at that...

**Jerod Santo:** So three points for me in round three. Excellent job, Jerod. Thank you very much. After three rounds, Emma's still though sitting in first with five, Amal with four, three-way tie at three between Lars, Taylor and myself. And Adam pulling up the caboose with two points.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, you know...

**Amal Hussein:** Do you all remember from the last time neuromuscular reeducation being like the acronym for NMR?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**Amal Hussein:** And we were just like "No way. Nope. Reeducation - like, that is really pushing it." And then no one picked it , and it was real. This just feels like that.

**Jerod Santo:** Can we talk about a form of meditation wherein you stare at your navel? I mean, come on... Let's move on, round four. This is our TLA round, which stands for Three Letter Acronym. It turns out it's a four-letter acronym this time... But it's a special round where I give an acronym, you all provide the words behind said acronym, and the definition of the words. So much like NMR last time was neuromuscular reeducation - you provide that, plus the definition.

\[38:00\] Okay, and the acronym that you're going to do is VLSI. V as in Victor, L as in loser, S as in Saturday, and I as in Indigo. But that's not what it stands for. It's not Victor Loser Saturday Indigo, if anybody was thinking they might submit that. Can I just say from the last round - yes, Taylor's was the wigglebone disease... Please don't say "also known as..." I just can't handle them, okay? \[laughter\] As soon as I saw that, I'm like "Oh, I'm gonna struggle... I can't read Also Known As'es."

**Adam Stacoviak:** I \[unintelligible 00:38:36.08\] have said "Similar to the facial myalgia" then.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that one actually worked. That one didn't crack me up.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's a made-up term in my house. The kids put their face in the bathtub, like under the water, and I tell them they're getting facial myalgia.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's a way to get them to not put their face in the water when their brothers are having a bath together. It's just, you know, there's things in there.

**Amal Hussein:** It's also a way for them to have trauma around putting their face in the water for the rest of their life...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my kids love it. They laugh their butts off. They don't even care. They actually think it's hilarious.

**Jerod Santo:** They want facial myalgia.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They do. They're like "Dad, I have facial myalgia." \[laughs\] It's not working. It's not working...

**Lars Wikman:** Give it a minute and they'll start going "Oh, I can't go to school today... You know, facial myalgia." \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Why were you out yesterday?" "I had facial myalgia..." "What in the world is that?!"

**Jerod Santo:** That sounds legit.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Lars Wikman:** I made a mistake this morning... I want to go get a drink. I chose lavender melon kombucha as my drink... \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Lavender is not the right choice for beverage or food.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. It's definitely not a consumable... It seems like a flavor that ChatGPT made up. They were like "Alright, ChatGPT, come up with a new flavor combo." And it's like "I'm a machine, I've never tasted anything... But okay, here it goes."

**Lars Wikman:** We had some lavender chocolate, and none of us could eat it.

**Amal Hussein:** It sounds disgusting.

**Lars Wikman:** The chocolate bit was fine, but it tasted like bed linens.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, yeah. Lavender, right?

**Lars Wikman:** Nicely-handled fresh bed linens... But it's just not something I want in my food.

**Jerod Santo:** Which is a great smell...

**Taylor Troesh:** If you like that, you should taste my homemade muffins. They taste exactly like bed linens.

**Emma Bostian:** Jerod, I altered my definition... So the text is edited if you just copy the new one...

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I kept mine exactly the same, Jerod, just so you know... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, we're throwing shade just because you're last place, Adam? Come on... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, snap!

**Jerod Santo:** Scary-spicy...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Coming hot!

**Amal Hussein:** Shots fired... Shots fired...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Everybody's always changing their answers \[unintelligible 00:40:57.12\] put it out there. Keeping it the same.

**Amal Hussein:** Making fun or giving Adam and Jerod a hard time - it's just so easy. You guys are such easy targets... It's because we all love you, so you're just so easy to like poke at...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, feel free to poke at me whenever you like.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like that.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Jerod, I'm a married lady, okay? I can't be poking randos...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, WTF does that TLA mean? VLSI. Six definitions. Vision Lens Spectrum Interceptor - the apparatus used to mimic the human eyes' ability to capture light. VLSI - Verilog Language System Integration - a language for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). VLSI - Vector Language Symbol Interference, a shorthand used to store large computational vector data as a means of reducing cloud storage costs. Number four, VLSI - Very Large Scale Integration, the process of creating an integrated circuit by combining millions or billions of transistors onto a single chip.

\[42:18\] Number five, Vector LASIK Surface Incision - a minimally-invasive type of dermal laser treatment using acute angles and low power. And number six, Vector Longitudinal Scalar Intersection, a Cartesian coordinate where two vectors intersect along a horizontal plane, typically used in aerospace engineering to calculate the angle at which the wings are attached to the fuselage. There you have it, six I think pretty good definitions this time around. One of those is the real definition, and the real acronym. And five of them are not.

**Lars Wikman:** I'm not convinced there's a real one in there...

**Amal Hussein:** I'm amazed that we used vector more than once.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Or did we?

**Jerod Santo:** Last round Taylor went first, so this round Emma will go first. Emma, which of those do you think is the correct definition?

**Emma Bostian:** Could you read one and five again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. One was the Vision Lens Spectrum Interceptor, an apparatus used to mimic the human eyes' ability to capture light, and five was Vector LASIK Surface Incision, a minimally-invasive type of dermal laser treatment using acute angles and low power.

**Taylor Troesh:** Just to let you guys know, that one's the correct one. That's what they did to fix my wiggle-bone disease. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** I mean, what are the chances we get three vectors out of six answers? So I have to assume it's gotta be one of those, right?

**Amal Hussein:** Well, Emma, in all fairness, these are all a bunch of software engineers, so I'm not surprised about that. We see the word V and we think vectors these days...

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Vector's the new cult, too.

**Emma Bostian:** But you literally just said you were surprised, so now I don't believe you...

**Amal Hussein:** Maybe I was playing a game.

**Emma Bostian:** I'll go with five... I'll just go with five, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma's going with five. Alright, we now go to Adam. Which one do you think it is?

**Adam Stacoviak:** None of them. Gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Vector? Victor? Was the vector victor?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm not going with vector... What's two and six again, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** Two and six?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like these are arbitrary numbers when you guys ask me for them. \[laughter\] Like "Yeah, three and seven..." Two is the Verilog Language System Integration, a language for Field Programmable Gate Arrays.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh.

**Jerod Santo:** Six was the Vector Longitudinal Scalar Intersection, a Cartesian coordinate where two vectors intersect along a horizontal plane; typically used in aerospace engineering to calculate the angle at which the wings are attached to the fuselage. Or fuselage, if you're so inclined.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The choice is so hard...

**Jerod Santo:** Please don't make me read these again.

**Amal Hussein:** This is really hard, honestly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was three again?

**Jerod Santo:** Three - Vector Language Symbol Interference. Do you want the full definition?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No.

**Jerod Santo:** No... \[laughs\]

**Lars Wikman:** Absolutely not.

**Jerod Santo:** That's good. I did not want to read it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Which bad one should I choose...? I'm gonna go with number two. Gosh, this Verilog stuff's got me.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two... The Verilog Language System Integration? Alright, you got it. Next up, Amal. \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** You're making all kinds of noises...

**Amal Hussein:** Well, no, because this is really hard.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It is hard.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, tell us your thought process. What are you thinking?

**Amal Hussein:** Well, what am I thinking is I think all the vector ones are from the engineers, which is pretty much everyone... So I want to go with a non-vector answer. So could we just summarize...? I don't need the definitions. Just give me the non-vector ones. Can you list those out?

**Jerod Santo:** The non-vector ones. The Verilog Language System Integration, the Vision Lens Spectrum Interceptor, and the Very Large Scale Integration.

**Lars Wikman:** \[46:02\] One of the vector ones was not programming or engineering in that way...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, it had to do with aerospace. Yeah. And I think that definition was way too long to be real. So that's my pry. I eliminated it there.

**Lars Wikman:** No, hold on... There was one more.

**Jerod Santo:** There's so many...

**Lars Wikman:** One of them was a vector laser, right?

**Jerod Santo:** There's three vectors. Vector LASIK, Vector Longitudinal, and Vector Language. And then there's other words too, but those are the three vectors.

**Amal Hussein:** What's the second one that you've read that was not vectors?

**Jerod Santo:** Vision Lens Spectrum Interceptor, the apparatus used to mimic the human eyes' ability to capture light.

**Amal Hussein:** Let's do that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Amal lands on that one.

**Amal Hussein:** And if I see somebody smiling here, then you know what? You got me. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Lars, what have you got?

**Lars Wikman:** My thinking is that the most kind of crisp engineery type definitions have been Emma's consistently, so I think a very long one is probably Emma, because it seems like nerd bait.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] It seems like nerd bait...

**Emma Bostian:** I'll take that as a compliment, actually...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I think that was a compliment.

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah, go for it. And the dumbest-seeming one, which I think is what Jerod would have picked, because he's absolutely kind of spicing up the definitions, seems to be the Very Large one. So read that one again, because I didn't catch all of it.

**Jerod Santo:** Very Large Scale Integration - the process of creating an integrated circuit by combining millions or billions of transistors onto a single chip.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, can I change my answer?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Amal Hussein:** Just for the record, I want to say that I would have picked that had I heard that definition again.

**Jerod Santo:** I've read it like six times.

**Lars Wikman:** I'm going with the Very Large one, because naming things in hardware is silly...

**Jerod Santo:** There he goes. He's got it. And Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** It is the Very Large one.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, confident man. It is the Very Large one. So are you picking it though? Because you've been known not to pick the one that's correct.

**Taylor Troesh:** I'm falling behind,, so I've got to pick the correct one this time.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Taylor had to pick the correct one. And Lars was on point, Taylor was on point; that is the correct one. Very Large Scale Integrations. So two points for each of you for getting it correct.

**Lars Wikman:** Now I'm super-curious if I was right about which one was Emma's...

**Adam Stacoviak:** She was number three.

**Jerod Santo:** You were wrong, because that was actually Taylor's. He's also good at nerd bait. Have you read his blog?

**Lars Wikman:** But he usually doesn't do it. \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Because I think VLSI has to do with FPGAs. So like, very large scale integration - it's like programming a whole bunch of tiny, tiny little hardware chips.

**Amal Hussein:** Nice.

**Lars Wikman:** Also known as Very Large...

**Emma Bostian:** Very Large, yeah.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, I'm happy that I now know what that strategy is, Lars. I think when in doubt, pick the most ridiculous one. I think that has seemed to be the most consistent --

**Lars Wikman:** That's not gonna be consistent, because it's gonna be mixing it up...

**Amal Hussein:** Really?

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah. Next time... Next time, there's going to be a definition with a spelling error in it.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...!

**Lars Wikman:** So he will be tripped up while reading it.

**Jerod Santo:** You're really meta-gaming this thing.

**Lars Wikman:** But that's one episode out still...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, speaking of spelling errors though, you guys, I think I would have actually won this round had I not spelled the wrong -- I was supposed to say Vector Language Symbol Inference. And this makes sense. It's a shorthand used to store large computational vector data as a means of reducing cloud storage costs. I'm thinking of, "How do I reduce my logging costs?" "Well, we use shorthands." I think that makes sense...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Here's where the problem is - you said all the vectors were engineers, and so at that point you outed yourself.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You peed in the pool.

**Jerod Santo:** You peed in the pool.

**Amal Hussein:** It doesn't matter. That's the point. You're supposed to do that stuff. But yes, you're right... I'm wrong. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Fair, fair. Alright. Well, let's get the rest of these figured out. So the Verilog one - that was Taylor's nerd bait and Adam fell for the bait, so he guessed that one, and that gave Taylor another point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good job, Taylor.

**Jerod Santo:** \[50:02\] Vector LASIK Surface Incision - Emma guessed that. That was Lars'es, so he also gains another point for tricking somebody; three for each of you. And Vision Lens Spectrum Interceptor - you know Amal loves Adam's definitions, so he got her with that one.

**Amal Hussein:** Of course he did... Like a moth to the flame, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. So three points for Lars, three points for Taylor, one point for Adam...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Was four Lars'es, though? Was Lars'es number four?

**Jerod Santo:** Four was the correct one, that was mine.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh. Okay, nevermind.

**Jerod Santo:** The Very Large Scale Integration. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because I was watching Lars laugh really hard when four was read... And I was thinking he laughed at his own thing, or it was that ridiculous. And I think it was both...

**Lars Wikman:** It was just funny that it was called Very Large...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Very Large Scale... Alright, after four rounds we have a two-way tie for first, Lars and Taylor. We have Emma in second with five, Amal in third with four, and Adam and Jerod tied for last, with three points. We move now to round five. Your word for round five is Zymurgy. Zymurgy. Oh, you put that in the chat.

**Lars Wikman:** That's not my real one. \[unintelligible 00:51:19.20\]

**Jerod Santo:** I like that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Oh man, this is hard. This one's tough.

**Jerod Santo:** For those not in the chat, Zymurgy, "A controversial dance move band from the 1988 Olympics." I just like the idea that it'd be a dance move band. And the specificity \[unintelligible 00:51:43.14\] is also a nice touch.

**Lars Wikman:** I actually had to do the math. I was like, \[unintelligible 00:51:50.08\]

**Emma Bostian:** Controversially, there was one in 1972...

**Lars Wikman:** Actually, that might work out...

**Jerod Santo:** You're pretty safe just guessing even-yeared numbers, right? Pretty safe.

**Lars Wikman:** That dance move was the cause of them having to do the 1989 Olympics. Did you go and start your printer, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. That's what I call that.

**Jerod Santo:** You call it the printer?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's what I just did, \[unintelligible 00:52:24.16\] starting the printer.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I'm very confused...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 00:52:31.01\]

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, did he flush the toilet? Is that what happened? \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** You heard that? It's really far away.

**Amal Hussein:** I did not hear a thing, for what it's worth...

**Jerod Santo:** The other day I was driving the kids home... I was driving home with the kids, and I told them when we get home, I'm gonna drop the kids off at the pool, and two of my kids were completely stunned, had no idea I was talking about... And my nine-year-old boy, he was onto it immediately. Oh, yeah. He's like "That is so funny." He said it for like the next three days straight.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, that's so funny...

**Jerod Santo:** "Drop the kids off at the pool!" Alright. I just thought of that because, you know --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I did not drop any kids off at the pool just now, just to be clear...

**Jerod Santo:** Gotta go run a print job. I'm gonna use that one next... \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Taking the browns to the Super-Bowl. \[laughter\]

**Lars Wikman:** The level has risen.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm pretty sure that was a number one and not a number two. If it was a number two, that's really impressive...

**Jerod Santo:** Speedy. Speedy Gonzales.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just printing over here, don't worry about me... \[laughter\] Turning on my printer.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Zymurgy - the result of a merge event of two zygotes. An academic term for the lack of a synergistic effect where two separate processes do not interact or affect one another in a measurable way. The process in which a zygote or a fertilized egg cell resulting from the union of an egg and a sperm embeds itself within the uterine lining. This process is also more commonly referred to as implantation.

\[54:02\] Zymurgy occurs when there is more than one asteroid headed in the same direction. The study of fermentation and brewing. Or the cooperative advantage of small, independent groups. Six definitions for Zymurgy. Adam, you're up first this time.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Read number six again, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Number six is the cooperative advantage of small independent groups.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's like the anomaly of them all, you know? They're all very scientific. Two was too long, five was fermentation... I'm going with six.

**Jerod Santo:** Six. Adam goes with the cooperative advantage of small, independent groups, and we go to Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm gonna go with number one.

**Jerod Santo:** Number one, the result of the merge event of two zygotes?

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, maybe not.

**Jerod Santo:** What do you mean?

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, fine. Fine. Let's do that. The other one with zygotes also sounded interesting, but let's do that one.

**Lars Wikman:** Merging goats...

**Jerod Santo:** Lars.

**Lars Wikman:** This one was genuinely very tricky... What was the one with just one zygote?

**Jerod Santo:** The process in which a zygote or a fertilized egg cell resulting from a union of an egg and a sperm embeds itself within the uterine lining. This process is also more commonly referred to as implantation. That was number three.

**Lars Wikman:** I'm not sure it's referred to as implantation, but okay. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Speculating the speculation. I love it. "I'm not sure it's referred to as that..."

**Amal Hussein:** It's just called making a baby. Baby-making.

**Jerod Santo:** There's lots of terms for it.

**Amal Hussein:** Human creation.

**Lars Wikman:** You know, a baby goat is called a kid. So kids become goats, and zygotes become kids.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, deep.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] That's the title of this episode.

**Amal Hussein:** That's very meta. Yeah. A baby goat is a kid.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Give me my baby goat..."

**Jerod Santo:** What are you gonna go with, Lars? Do you like that one, or did implantation scare you off?

**Lars Wikman:** No, I'm trying to remember the other ones.

**Amal Hussein:** They were all pretty crappy, for what it's worth... \[laughter\] Not our best round.

**Jerod Santo:** We have the study of fermentation and brewing, we have more than one asteroid headed in the same direction... Do you want more? ...with the cooperative advantage of small independent groups...

**Lars Wikman:** I'll actually go with the small independent groups as well.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Taylor, your turn.

**Taylor Troesh:** I have no clue. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Welcome to the club.

**Taylor Troesh:** You guys took the good one. Let's go with the fermentation. Was there one about fermentation?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. The study of fermentation in brewing.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, that sounds wrong, but let's do it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\] Oh, my gosh...

**Lars Wikman:** I think that's called hipsterism.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. And Emma...

**Lars Wikman:** Originally, I was gonna pick number one as well, but then I'm thinking, can two zygotes actually merge? I don't think -- is that scientifically possible? And it sounds very much like the merging of zygotes, so that seems like an easy definition. Also, the last one sounds like corporate BS, so it could also be true... What is a corporate advantage or collaborative advantage?

**Jerod Santo:** A cooperative advantage of small independent groups.

**Emma Bostian:** Like, what the hell does that mean?

**Taylor Troesh:** Game theory, dude...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Game theory, dude... \[laughter\] I love it.

**Jerod Santo:** Pretty defensive there, Taylor.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't know, man. I can't get on board with the -- the fermentation is like a scientific thing that happens with growth and whatnot...

**Taylor Troesh:** It's like metallurgy, zymurgy...

**Emma Bostian:** But then there's synergy, which is also cooperation of team people, so I'm like "Hmm..."

**Jerod Santo:** Right. So you're gonna go with corporate, or you're gonna go with beer?

**Amal Hussein:** Whoever made up that cooperation thing is gonna get a whole boatloat of points this round.

**Emma Bostian:** \[58:10\] I'm gonna trust Taylor and go with the fermentation, because I feel like we would have heard the term zymurgy if it was really a corporate BS word. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, that's pretty good logic, actually. Alright, Taylor and Emma team up. No spread. Wow. This is dangerous, guys...

**Amal Hussein:** I'm an independent on number one. I just want to put that out there.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Tell her, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** Amal -- let's start right there then. Amal independently picked Adam's again. \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Adam, I hate you! What's going on? This is not fair. This is not fair at all.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like clockwork.

**Lars Wikman:** As per usual, it doesn't go well for the independents. Sorry to say...

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\] Yes...

**Jerod Santo:** Adam teamed up with Lars to pick the cooperative advantage of small independent groups... Emma almost picked it, but she thought we would know about it if it was a real silly term... And it's a fake silly term made up by Taylor. So two points there.

**Lars Wikman:** Good one.

**Amal Hussein:** It's not even science. That's what I was trying to understand, y'all; that's not even STEM. Like, how was that -- like, I didn't want to point that out, but it's not.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's game theory, guys...

**Jerod Santo:** It's game theory, which is science.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\] I like how you responded "It's game theory, dude."

**Jerod Santo:** And the spread was not applied... So a lot riding on this. Taylor and Emma both thought zymurgy was the study of fermentation and brewing... Unfortunately, they were correct. That is the correct definition, which means I score zero points. Emma gets two for that, Taylor gets four for the round... Big round for Taylor, moving him in the first place with 10 points. He's two points away from stealing this one. I think we should start minding the Taylor spread, as he has 10. Emma has seven, in second, Lars has six, Amal and Adam with four, and me, a meager flask three.

**Break:** \[01:00:03.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** Round six. Your word - I guess it's a phrase in this case - for round six is Wirth's Law. Wirth is the name, and Law is the game. Please submit to me your definitions...

**Taylor Troesh:** I really feel like I've heard of this, but I have no idea...

**Lars Wikman:** Yeah, I've heard of this, too. What is it...?

**Taylor Troesh:** Game theory, dude.

**Jerod Santo:** Game theory, dude.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's gonna be my answer to everything from now.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's better than an It Depends.

**Taylor Troesh:** That's what I'm gonna tell my clients. "So how do we do that?" "Well, game theory, dude."

**Jerod Santo:** It's better than saying automagical. You just say it's game Theory.

**Amal Hussein:** What's wrong with saying automagical? Stop hating on that. It's a great word.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a stupid word.

**Amal Hussein:** I saw your little thing about that. No, it's a fantastic --

**Jerod Santo:** No, it's not.

**Amal Hussein:** Automagic... Every time I use it, especially outside of tech settings, people fall in love with me, give me their numbers, and stuff... It's crazy.

**Jerod Santo:** That's one of the reasons why it's stupid. It's like manipulative.

**Amal Hussein:** \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** All I can think of is Sturgeon's Law right now, which is -- Sturgeon's Law is 90% of everything is crap.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good law.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Wirth's Law.

**Lars Wikman:** Pegleg boy from Diablo.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... I don't play that game.

**Lars Wikman:** It was a very good game.

**Jerod Santo:** I heard that.

**Amal Hussein:** I think we need to play music during the live show, not the edited show... Just putting it out there, Jerod. It's time to step up your host game.

**Lars Wikman:** Elevator music. Can we have Mat in for --

**Jerod Santo:** Making up jingles?

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, that would be nice... Just for some \[unintelligible 01:05:55.27\] make up jargon during the strumming, just to inspire us...

**Taylor Troesh:** Or actually now that BMC has been on the show... Just be here. Just Polka...

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:06:10.27\] Yeah, live VMC would be sweet.

**Amal Hussein:** That would be extremely distracting for me... I love music, especially EDM...

**Taylor Troesh:** Well, it's gonna be Polka, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you're the one that requested it, Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** I know, but I didn't request EDM, live EDM, with a DJ. That's not what I -- that's a party for me.

**Jerod Santo:** We throw parties around here. It's what we do.

**Amal Hussein:** That's true, that's true...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's see. Am I missing some still? I'm missing Adam's. Consistently the last enterer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I just can't think of anything. I've got law block.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that like \[unintelligible 01:06:46.18\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Amal Hussein:** Taylor, I think we need to get you a T-shirt that says "I started from the bottom and now I'm on top." Remember last time? I think you were the expected winner, but then it turned out to be Lars...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Taylor Troesh:** I expected Lars to win... \[laughter\]

**Lars Wikman:** Thank you.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. Look at him.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, Taylor is within striking distance. We begin round six, Wirth's Law... We have six definitions. Number one, the quality of a codebase is inversely proportional to the number of people that work on it. Number two, two particles of the same mass, but different densities, will have the same release of energy during combustion. Number three, an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower, more rapidly that hardware is becoming faster. Number four, science can never be used to prove something. Number five - proposed in the late 1900s, Wirth's Law states that the security of a cryptographic system depends on the key length and algorithmic complexity rather than the secrecy of the algorithm. And number six... \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** This one has to be very serious... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Also known as meager flask...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**Amal Hussein:** Also known as meager flask...

**Jerod Santo:** And number six, Wirth's Law - when in doubt, Pareto's Principle.

**Lars Wikman:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** I have a feeling I know who wrote that.

**Jerod Santo:** Wirth's Law - when in doubt, Pareto's Principle.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** We begin now with Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** I think three sounded the most interesting, and so did five. Could you repeat those two?

**Jerod Santo:** Three was the adage on computer performance, which states that the software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster. Number five was the security of a cryptographic system depends on the key length and algorithmic complexity rather than the secrecy of the algorithm.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, that's too many words. I think I'm gonna go with three.

**Jerod Santo:** Three. Very good. Lars?

**Lars Wikman:** I'll go with the cryptographic one.

**Jerod Santo:** Cryptographic one, that's number five. Taylor?

**Taylor Troesh:** I completely forgot all of them, so I'm gonna pile on with Amal, because she's gone independent a few times, and I feel like I need to support her.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, thanks. It was getting lonely over here, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] She sounds unimpressed. Okay. He's gonna pile on... So that's with the adage on computer performance etc, etc.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, there was two computer performance ones, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, number one and number three. So you're on number three, or did you want number one? The quality of a codebase is inversely proportional to the number of the people that work on it.

**Taylor Troesh:** That sounds fake. Let's go with three.

**Amal Hussein:** And I think for the sake of the game, let's hope that I'm wrong, and so is Taylor. I just want to put that out there.

**Jerod Santo:** No problem. Okay. Emma, what are you thinking?

**Emma Bostian:** Man... What was number two again?

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:09:54.00\] Number two was Wirth's Law states that two particles of the same mass but different densities will have the same release of energy during combustion.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm so tired of the space ones, not for any particular reason other than my brain does not comprehend the meaning behind the words... So I'm torn between one and whichever one Amal and Taylor piled onto, so...

**Jerod Santo:** That's three.

**Emma Bostian:** I'll go one to spread it out.

**Amal Hussein:** For what it's worth, the particles don't have to be in space. Like, they can be any particles. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Isn't it all space?

**Jerod Santo:** That's not worth much, Amal... Thanks though.

**Emma Bostian:** Too many words.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** I just wanted to make sure... Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Amal wants to clarify the definition, for some reason... Adam, what are you thinking?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm not picking two, but I want to hear it again. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You want to hear it again?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. End to end.

**Jerod Santo:** Wirth's Law states that two particles of the same mass, but different densities, will have the same release of energy during combustion. And in parentheses it says "Whether it's in space or not." \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** What about number one again? What was that one again? Inversely what?

**Jerod Santo:** Number one, the quality of a codebase is inversely proportional to the number of people that work on it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And three they're piling on. What's the difference with that one? Computer performance what?

**Jerod Santo:** Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. Let's hang there, with everybody else...

**Jerod Santo:** You're gonna hang out with everybody else?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Amal Hussein:** I personally actually believe in that, which is why I picked it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's truth right there... I'm not sure if it's a law, but that's truth.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, let's start with Emma. She thought perhaps Wirth's Law is that the quality of a codebase is inversely proportional to the number of people that work on it. Taylor thought that sounded made up, and that's because he made it up, and so she gets one point for that. He's now one point away of being the victor.

Lars thought that perhaps it was the cryptographic system that depends on the key length and the algorithmic complexity, rather than the secrecy of the algorithm... And that was Emma's definition. So one point for her.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, Emma, you do have the most technical and nerdy definitions, I just want to put that out there, for sure.

**Emma Bostian:** I read a lot, you know?

**Amal Hussein:** That's why I also projected that you would be the winner of this game, to be honest, just because you're the one who reads the most...

**Emma Bostian:** Well, thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, excellent definition. Borderline, they're too good. They're a little bit too long, a little bit too studious... They need to be --

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I get it... I'll dumb it down for everyone, it's okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Dumb it down for us, would ya?

**Amal Hussein:** They're too ChatGPT, you know what I mean? But I know you didn't use it. It was like EmmaGPT you know...

**Emma Bostian:** I know.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, she's like a robot.

**Lars Wikman:** Do you have a book list somewhere?

**Emma Bostian:** Of what?

**Lars Wikman:** Of the books you read?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Just books...

**Emma Bostian:** I mean, I'm on Goodreads, but I read every genre. So if you've got a preference, come see me. I'll hook you up.

**Jerod Santo:** Nice. Well, it all comes down to this, since Taylor is one point away from winning... He piled on. We have Amal, Taylor and Adam. They're all on number three... And so maybe they're all correct, or maybe they're all wrong, and we play on. Wirth's Law - an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster. It sounds true, and it sounds like Wirth's Law indeed. So you guys all got it correct.

**Amal Hussein:** Yaaay!!

**Jerod Santo:** It is Wirth's Law.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, no. Taylor, no!

**Jerod Santo:** No...! We're giving Taylor three points for the round. Adam gets two, Amal gets two... And after six rounds of play, Taylor with 13 points is our winner.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Yay!

**Amal Hussein:** Yaay!

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good job, Taylor.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, good job, actually. Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** As the victor, you now have to give a speech.

**Taylor Troesh:** I have to give a speech?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. So right now, on the spot, you have to give some kind of speech. We'll wait eagerly your words.

**Taylor Troesh:** \[01:14:00.24\] I think the last long thing I wrote about on taylor.town, my website, was my pardoning of engineers. I pardoned all junior engineers... I think that's the last long speech I gave very impassioned. I think if you want to read that online, that's still there. It also has an associated little repo called wigwam.directory. That's a URL that you can type into your browser, Wigwam.directory... And that will lead you to a list of alternative projects to bloat... Because Wirth's Law states that software is getting slower than hardware is getting faster... I don't like that. So wigwam.directory is a, I think, \[unintelligible 01:14:47.20\] solution to that. So that's my speech. And pointer to a speech.

**Jerod Santo:** Very good. We will link up the pointer to the speech, as well as to the wigwam.directory. I didn't know of this TLD; that's a new one to me. Very cool. Let's do some quick postgame analysis as we close; a nice cooldown... Lars, your thoughts on this round of \#define, and why you didn't win.

**Lars Wikman:** Oh... Because I played too poorly. That's why.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, okay.

**Lars Wikman:** But it was fun to see Taylor kind of start by going into his old shenanigans, and just like, there was something goofy... It was the wigglebone... I think it started with the wiggle bone, but then he just played it straight, I think, generally.

**Amal Hussein:** He's got a great poker face...

**Lars Wikman:** ...when he wants to...

**Amal Hussein:** Because he always looks a little ridiculous, you know? So it's like, you can't tell.

**Taylor Troesh:** Game Theory.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Game theory, dude.

**Taylor Troesh:** Game theory.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. If you look at his eyes when you're reading out things, he's just like an owl, hunting in the dark. He's like this, like that...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dang...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, yeah, you're very -- I can't tell what you're thinking. You have the best poker face out of everyone. Congrats.

**Taylor Troesh:** Amal, when I look into your eyes, I see --

**Amal Hussein:** Aww... Do you want me to take my glasses off? Would that be better for you?

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, there we go. There we go.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** This is the eyes of a crow; like a very smart crow... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** That's such a compliment. Thank you. I love crows. Crows are so --

**Taylor Troesh:** \[unintelligible 01:16:25.01\] that solves puzzles.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...

**Amal Hussein:** That's like the nicest thing anyone has said to me this year. Thank you.

**Emma Bostian:** You need to get out more, dear...

**Taylor Troesh:** This year. We're at the end of the year, too. That's good.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a long time. Yeah, that's a very nice compliment.

**Amal Hussein:** That is.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's go to Adam. Adam, you were you're trailing behind, but you actually pulled into a three-way tie for third place at the end of the game with that last round. Your thoughts on \#define and your placement here. Third place... Nothing to shake a stick out, or at... How do you feel?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:17:02.14\] I think it's just challenging to write these definitions. It really is. It's challenging, because they -- you can be so ridiculous because you're trying to make something up. And then you're also trying to decipher through the BS. And then you've got Taylor here, who sometimes does throw the oddities out there. And so you've really got to pay close attention to what's on the field, and what to choose from. And you obviously can't choose your own BS, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. But...

**Jerod Santo:** Amal, curious why it is that you find yourself so attracted to Adam's definitions.

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, I don't know; years of listening to Changelog, perhaps... I've socially conditioned my brain, I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... \[It's better!\] That's really a lot. Playing the long game.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. It's better, exactly! Yeah. He just sounds so authoritative. What can I say...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Thank you.

**Amal Hussein:** But also, my request is for next time that we just totally flip the script on the rules. Made up words, made up definitions, and points go to the person who gets the most hits. You know what I mean?

**Jerod Santo:** So there is no -- there has to be a real definition. Or you're just saying the words are all made up?

**Amal Hussein:** No, there doesn't -- I mean, everything. Why does there have to be? Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What you're saying is, when in doubt, Pareto's Principle.

**Amal Hussein:** Basically, yes. That's correct.

**Jerod Santo:** That was one of Adam's definitions that you did not pick, was that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. It was the worst. I just couldn't come up with anything.

**Amal Hussein:** He couldn't come up with anything. I knew that. So he was like "When in doubt...", you know...

**Jerod Santo:** I like the idea that somebody's law though just refers to somebody else's law... That's kind of a fun idea.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, it's a principle.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah... But I couldn't actually get through without laughing because of the reference.

**Lars Wikman:** There is Hofstadter's law, which states that software projects always fall behind, even if you take into account Hofstadter's law.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah. I like that one. Self-referential... Emma, your first game of \#define. You fared quite admirably... I think you ended up in second place. Excellent job.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, neat-oh!

**Amal Hussein:** Great job.

**Emma Bostian:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** What are your thoughts? What is your opinion? How do you feel?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... I would say etymology is not a gift we are all granted with, as is displayed by the -- no, I'm just kidding. I will say, being too intelligent was my downfall... So if you were to have me back, I will change my definitions for the plebeians of the tech industry.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dang...

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, this was a lot of fun. I genuinely had no idea about any of them.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. We just need to watch some reality TV before you come on the show. That's what needs to happen.

**Emma Bostian:** I do... I'm a huge Love Island fan, so I will bulk up on it.

**Jerod Santo:** Bulk up on Love Island. That'd be a good game plan for next time.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. That'll take you down a few notches, just temporarily; just for the game.

**Emma Bostian:** That's true.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, this has been round two of \#define. We have a new champion, Taylor Troesh... And we have five new losers, some of which already were... And we have me, your humble host, and sometimes not so humble... Thank you for listening, thank you for playing along. If you liked this game, go back and listen to round one, where I get defeated by the humble mega flask; lols all around... And that's a fun one as well. If you like these games in general, and you want to hear more of them, do let us know. We enjoy playing them, and if you enjoy listening to them, we will do them more often. So that's \#define, that's Changelog & Friends. Any final words, Adam, before we just say goodbye?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, bye, y'all. Thanks for hanging out.

**Amal Hussein:** Bye!
