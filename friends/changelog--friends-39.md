**Jerod Santo:** So what I was about to say, and I'll say now, is that some of our Ship It listeners are on to us. You know what I'm talking about?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The sample in the theme? Oh no, you mean what you've done with the theme.

**Jerod Santo:** Both.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh...

**Jerod Santo:** And the outro theme.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Do tell.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you know that one? I mean, you wrote it. You made it. We've got two samples. Oh, you don't know we're using that for an outro now. That's probably why you're so confused.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it one of the punny ones?

**Jerod Santo:** It's one of the punny ones.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So we're using the new theme sample as the new theme, and then we've replaced the old outro music with the other one.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Mm-hm.

**Jerod Santo:** And our Ship It listeners in this channel, they're pretty smart people.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** They are smart people.

**Jerod Santo:** Like, "Wait a second... I know what you guys are trying to do to me."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Do to us, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** So that's kind of cool.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sorry about that...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] It's nice to have a secret, like in plain sight, but it's also nice when that secret kind of slips out for insiders, you know?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Indeed. I like an Easter egg.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's cool.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, here we are... We are hanging out with the mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder, our beat freak in residence, our beat master... What else do we call you? BMC...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's pretty much it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Surely...

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Don't call me Shirley..." Naked Gun.

**Jerod Santo:** That's '80s. It's going back even further than our Ship It samples... Which we will not name. We'll let other people figure them out.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, I was wondering. Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** We're here to talk about Dance Party. This is our newest album, out for a few months now...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** By Changelog Beats and Breakmaster Cylinder. A collab, as we do. We've been collabing for years... And this one's cool. Basically, we're like "Hey, BMC, take all of the songs that you've made for us, that are danceable, or they're just like raveable, or you can hear them potentially in a club..." You can imagine them being played loudly at night...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and put them onto an album.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It can be loud at night.

**Jerod Santo:** And you did it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** And I did it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is that it?

**Jerod Santo:** That's it. That's the show. Thank you for doing that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You're welcome.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I don't know if we want to go track by track, because there's 21 tracks; we might be here a while. I love to talk about the mix overall, because this mix is different than our other albums that you've done, intentionally so... People may be wondering if it was an accident or intentional, and this was very much intentional...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So I want to talk about that. Adam, what's on your agenda to tease out of BMC?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I almost said, oontz-oontz-oontz, but he beat me to it, so...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** So we already got that one checked off.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** How do you spell oontz, by the way?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know. Like ounce maybe?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I don't know if you do the double o, or the --

**Jerod Santo:** I would do like oontz.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, maybe that's right.

**Jerod Santo:** How about you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I agree with the mix of this one was different. You put extra sprinkles of sugar on top of this one I think too, in terms of the detail in the mix, in comparison to others. The fading, and the mixing, and all that stuff.

**Jerod Santo:** Tell us about it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Tell us about it. It was in the '90s when I listened a lot of trance CDs, or things like that. You can hear the DJ trying to switch between tracks, and sometimes it goes really well, and sometimes it's a little clunky; you can hear them do it. And I found that endearing. So I made it deliberately sound like I was trying to get from one to the other, and do it as best as I can, but it wouldn't be totally perfect... And the beats aren't like off from each other or anything, but like trying to get one song that's in one key into another one that's in a different key... And be creative... I don't know, it just sounds good. It feels good. You press Play, and then the whole thing doesn't stop until the end.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Yeah, I like that. What happens is -- tell us how it works. So during one track, the next track overlays it for the last N seconds, and it fades from one to the other...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And then if you just start from track three, for instance, it's just normal. But if you start at the end of track two, there's -- it's not its own song, right? It's got some part of the other song into it to allow for that smooth fade.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. There's some track three at the end of track two.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I was just listening to it. I guess some of them have little pieces of the previous, but not too obviously, hopefully.

**Jerod Santo:** Very little. Yeah.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's a couple that are very deliberate, where it comes in with it. And I liked that, honestly. I dug how that worked out. I dug the detail put in there.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes, I like details. Also, it was like a nostalgia thing for me. I don't know if that's gonna mean a lot to too many other people, but...

**Jerod Santo:** \[08:09\] Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but I'm really concerned about Paul.

**Jerod Santo:** You're just jumping to the end of the album, dude.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I wouldn't be concerned about Paul, I'd be concerned for Moby... And also, I did not come up with his name. This was literally the request for the song; you were like "Make it sound like this." I feel like I should clarify...

**Jerod Santo:** What song are you talking about? I don't even know what you guys are talking about.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No idea, huh...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** We can wait then. Let's let it be a teaser.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** A cliffhanger for those who are thinking, "Gosh, just share the best", and we're not going to do it till the end.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I thought we would start with the start, because I'm not Tarantino... I'm more traditional. So I thought, you know... This. Do you guys hear this?

**Adam Stacoviak:** We stole this.

**Jerod Santo:** This is different.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Did you?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Well, internally stole it...

**Jerod Santo:** We stole it from you.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, okay. I was like...

**Adam Stacoviak:** We stole it from ourselves.

**Jerod Santo:** So you put this crowd noise in at the beginning of the album.

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's like "What? I made that. Are you kidding me?"

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Who? What?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he's like "What did I --"

**Adam Stacoviak:** I got friends together.

**Jerod Santo:** First of all, did you actually make all those noises? Or is that one of those things where you get some wav files and --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, I just found a bunch of crowds. It's like three different ones kind of blended together to keep it from -- to make them all like roar with approval at the right moment, and then fade out in a way that doesn't sound too bad.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. And a lot of detail in there too to get that right... Because you're right, it does naturally perfectly fade. And then about two-ish seconds into the crowd coming up, there's sort of a swell... Like as if the track began, and the track got good, and everybody got excited about the track coming into play. Like as if you're live at the DJ.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I pictured it like the DJ finally walked out on stage. Like, they're all kind of waiting, they hear it coming, and they're like "Oh, there they are."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** "Ohhh, it's that's that guy...!!"

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's like "Oh, we're getting started...!" It's called Party Started, so...

**Adam Stacoviak:** The lights came on... Kind of thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Like, it's time. It's time.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, for sure.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's so on.

**Jerod Santo:** And then we stole it from you. So now we just put it in random places, at the top of the Changelog, for instance... You know, we kind of figured that -- I don't know, Adam, do you just think people would naturally be excited, they'd be clapping for us if we came out on stage?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, honestly, when these albums come out, I like to reuse a lot of the music we use in them, obviously, in like interstitials... I'm like, I want to just pay homage to what's been released, so that when people go and listen to it, it sounds familiar, in a way. So I kind of borrowed it temporarily, and now it's kind of stuck. So I like it. I think we need to have different variations of it at some point. Having a crowd begin kind of feels a bit like truly world class, in my opinion.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** But initially, it was just to give a nod to the album out there, and have similarity.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** "Changelog...!"

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. It could be delusions of grandeur, it could be a little bit of that...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No way... Have you done any live shows ever? People would cheer.

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, we've been on stage and done some stuff, but not the -- some clapping. I don't know if I would say to cheers. We've had claps, I don't think we've ever had cheers. But I would love if we could like work in "Adam Stacoviak I love youuuuuu...!" \[laughter\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I could totally do that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:11:20.26\] away from the microphone.

**Jerod Santo:** We could just imagine it into existence...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Do you have nicknames? Like the Stack?

**Jerod Santo:** The Stack, yeah. We could definitely do some nicknames.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Some people call me Stack, some call me Stacks, with an s at the end, plural...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Change it to an X and there's your DJ name already.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There we go, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know if Skrillex would allow it. It's too close. Stax, Skrillex...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, he'd \[unintelligible 00:11:45.10\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's true.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:11:48.05\] Clapping is like cheering of the hands. That's on the way...

**Jerod Santo:** \[11:56\] Yeah, I think we're on our way... Here's what I think would happen actually, if we ever did do -- because we hint, and we tease, and we talk about a conference, a party, a meet-up, a show, a hangout... We've never done any of these things. But every time we're talking about it behind the scenes, we're like "Do you think BMC would come and DJ that thing live?" And Adam's like "Oh, I'm sure." And I'm like "I'm not sure, but I hope so."

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've already asked him.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh yeah. We already got a yes. So that's where I think we would get our cheer for the first time, is like when you drop the beat initially, live, for Changelog listeners and friends... That's when I think our claps are going to turn it into cheers for the first time.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That would be an honor.

**Jerod Santo:** I would cheer.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Aw, thanks.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I would have to join the party and cheer as well.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** From peer pressure?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Well, pure joy, really.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Pure Joy. That's good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Tapped right into my intravenous vein there, it's just like "Got it." The joy is in there.

**Jerod Santo:** Intravenously. Wow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The BMC has entered the building... That's how it goes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's awesome.

**Adam Stacoviak:** But the way this album opens up is like the truly good beat though. I mean, you got the party started, Jerod. You kind of played that. There's like - what, 20 seconds of cheer, and then... You know, that beat drops.

**Jerod Santo:** And then we drop the Bump on a Log.

**Sample**: \[13:14\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I do like these for openers. That bass is like sparse, and \[13:25\] if you ever heard the song a long time ago...

**Jerod Santo:** Right. That's my favorite part. What do you call that though, \[unintelligible 00:13:31.07\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's a synthesizer. It's a little atonal... I mean, it has pitch, but it's like not notes necessarily, is it? I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** This is what I've always loved about electronic music, is the layers. Like, you're just layering on more sounds over time... That's like the move, isn't it?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... You're supposed to be thinking about how many sounds can a listener really process at once.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm gonna stop that so we can talk to each other, but man... Yeah, it just starts simple, and then it's just more and more and more, and it's very mathematical... Right? It has to be timed out right, otherwise it's weird.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I like weird man stuff... I mean, that one isn't an example of it, but I like instruments with different length patterns kind of overlapping.

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha. That's some of your taste there... But yeah, is starts out with a banger, Bump on a Log... I think the other one that we potentially considered was Bass is the Place to start it out...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Sample**: \[14:34\]

**Jerod Santo:** And prior to that you had something entirely different, and I was like "It has to start with a banger." Remember that?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes. You were right.

**Jerod Santo:** What were you starting with, do you remember?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I don't know... Four to the Floor... One of these Halt & Catch Pyre songs maybe?

**Jerod Santo:** Right...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Of which there are many.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They're good, but they're not Bump on a Log.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** This is way more amped, I agree. It was a good choice.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. The way that comes in is like "This is a party."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, it's a party.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And you had better dance, or else...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Dancing is mandatory.

**Adam Stacoviak:** For sure. I mean, whenever this officially dropped on Spotify, it was listable to the world -- I think actually it might have been the Dropbox version of it before it was out there... I played it in my living room for my kids, and they love the dance. We always have dance parties. We literally have dance parties already. And so I'd throw various types of music like this onto the speakers, bump it to 75-80, whatever the number is, basically almost 100... And we'd just rock it out. And these kids literally danced the entire album.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, sweet!

**Adam Stacoviak:** The whole album. I mean, I skipped over some of the middle parts, to get to the -- because I was actually thinking like "I'm QA-ing this. How does this sound on real speakers, really loud, as if I'm a listener out there, enjoying it in my living room, on my big banging speakers, and I'm just going at it, basically?"

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sweet.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[16:12\] So I skipped a little bit, but for the whole album, dancing it out, the whole way.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Kids' reactions is perfect.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They were loving it, they had showers afterwards, and went right to bed, directly.

**Jerod Santo:** You wore them out, BMC. You wore them out.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** This album will wear out your children. Okay. Cool. That's high praise. That's super-high praise.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And the speakers, just to be super-nerdy... The speakers I had them on were Klipsch PRO-250RPW LCRs. Just so you know. So I have dual \[unintelligible 00:16:40.27\] a 1" titanium dome tweeter, \[unintelligible 00:16:46.25\] just so you know.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Just off the top of your head, huh?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just so you know... And probably about 100 Watts, at least, per speaker.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sweet.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Maybe 150 per speaker. So that's a decent beat. That's a decent bump.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you know what he's talking about? Because I know what Klipsch is, but beyond that, I just...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, no, no... Remember Skullcandy head buds.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I know those...! \[laughter\] No, I'm kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** That's what this is designed to sound good on...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, he knows Dr. Klipsch.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Vaguely...

**Adam Stacoviak:** He should.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** But now that I know that, please listen to all the music and tell me how it bumps, because that's going to be just the best possible system...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's where I test things at, I test things in that living room, or in the theater, with similar speakers. But Dr. Klipsch made famous the Klipsch horn. It's this old school -- back in the '50s-'60s invented this furniture-style speaker... And it's just magnificent to look at as a speaker. And all the tech that Klipsch has today has come from his original -- he's a physicist. He's all about sound design and whatnot. And he's done some amazing speakers. So Klipsch is my brand. That's what I love.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Excellent.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, speaking of playing it for your kids, this reminds me of the initial Go Time theme song, which we made years and years ago together. You made most of it... We gave you feedback... And I remember playing it for Ezra when he was two. He's like almost 10 now. So it had to be eight years ago.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dang...

**Jerod Santo:** And I remember he was sitting at the kitchen table - I had a video of this, and I remember sending it to you...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes, I do remember.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and he just goes crazy with the head bumps. And then it finally ends and he goes "Will you play that again for me, dad?" or something real cute.

**Audio**: \[18:33\]

**Jerod Santo:** And he was just -- that Go Time theme song was all he wanted to listen to.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Excellent. That's awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. So you rate highly with the youth.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I care about that. I really do.

**Jerod Santo:** It sounded sarcastic, but I think it was sincere.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, no, no. They'll tell you if something's terrible.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Or they'll just like walk away and be like -- you know...

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, when they're dancing, it's all out of pure vibes. There's no putting on airs.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Totally.

**Jerod Santo:** And if they don't want to dance, they're not going to. They're like "This song isn't moving me."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No.

**Jerod Santo:** So that is a high praise.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, it's always been like -- yeah.

**Break**: \[19:25\]

**Jerod Santo:** So take us through the Halt & Catches, because this was Halt & Catch Fire inspired music; there's about four of them. Halt & Catch Pyre... Halt & Do Not Pass Go, Halt & Catch a Cold... Which is awesome. And then my favorite, Halt & Cacciatore, which I had to look up... That's like a pasta dish, or something?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** A pasta dish.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Halt & Cacciatore.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Halt & Cacciatore. Not catch a Tory.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. It's all one word. It's an Italian word. I think Adam was bugging you for some Halt & Catch Fire-inspired stuff, and it must have went on for a while, because you ended up with a lot of tracks.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, he super-was. You super-were.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that the whole story? \[laughs\] Is there more?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, if you ever listen to it, it has a really, really specific sound to it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it does.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's an '80s, early '90s, maybe '80s kind of vibe...

**Jerod Santo:** BMC, what's your favorite of these four? We'll play a few seconds from it here.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The first one's my favorite. Halt & Catch Pyre.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's probably the first one we did too, so it's a little closer to the...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh yeah, this was at the top of the Changelog. Still is, isn't it? Yeah, Adam uses this one as his intro.

**Sample**: \[23:59\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I like that broken up little synth thing that's barely appearing... There's a gate on it, so it kind of crackles... If that means anything.

**Jerod Santo:** Why is it crackle? Because there's a gate on it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Because it will only play when it's reached a certain volume level... And then everything after that gets cut off immediately. So it's a fast attack, fast release. And that's kind of cool. You can make things sound really electronic, like anything -- I do this with the cellos and things, or flutes, or whatever... It will just crackle into existence, and then it'll disappear, because whatever was before it was not quite loud enough.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha. That's interesting.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I actually go between those two. I don't always do that one. I do a couple of the others. So basically, all the Halt & Catch whatevers I've used for intros - I dig those ones, of course. What else do I use for intros? I don't even know the name of them, I just know how they sound.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, the titles mean nothing...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the titles are meaningless, which is why sometimes you're like "I have to hear it first to even know what you're talking about" when you say the name.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yup, yup.

**Jerod Santo:** Like Impetuous Loggers for Change. I can't even imagine what that sounds like right now...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No... How many titles can I put log in?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. You've done a pretty good job with that. Of the titles though, of the Halt titles, I have to admit, Halt & Do Not Pass Go is just \[unintelligible 00:25:26.02\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah? I'm glad.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I think it was Tetris Schmetris, which is jumping the gun a little bit, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, we can go there.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh yeah, Tetris Schmetris. That's for that documentary you saw about Tetris.

**Jerod Santo:** Tetris, the movie.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Tetris, the movie.

**Jerod Santo:** Which I got all excited about and then I never watched it. It's kind of what I do.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's nonfiction, right? I mean, it's a documentary. It's not like walks from space...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, no, it's a dramatic fiction poetry story...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Got it.

**Jerod Santo:** What do you call those?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Dramatization?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, a dramatization of a true story... Which was interesting, particularly to us, because Adam actually interviewed the guy in which it was dramatizing.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Really?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[26:05\] Hank Rogers, yeah. It was really interesting to watch that, considering the conversation, and I guess how old that conversation is in comparison to I guess just the entropy of Tetris, really. You can't stop Tetris, you know? I mean, the film is evident of that. I won't ruin it for anybody, but it gets out. It can't be stopped.

**Jerod Santo:** You can't stop the signal.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Licensing couldn't stop it, governments couldn't stop it...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Wow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And it's really interesting how the game began. It began as a programmer's love to program, but then to program a game. And that to me was the beautiful part of it, was the connection between Hank Rogers and the fellow that created it. I think his name is Sergey, if I recall correctly. It was based on programming. Like, what language, how was it written? All that stuff. It was the game too, but then it was also how was the game written to change it to be more playable, and change the rules of the game?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's so cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's pretty wild.

**Jerod Santo:** So you watched it... I think it was like on Apple TV Plus, or something... And then you said "This music is good."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** You being Adam. And then he said "BMC... Tetris Schmetris, please."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I said "Okay."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I don't know if it came like -- I think I was like... What did I say to you, BMC? I was just like "This album... All the music in this entire film is amazing. Go watch the film, and be inspired", I think is probably what I said. Some version of that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because the movie does have a phenomenal soundtrack. It's really well done. I think that's the beauty of what we do in this version of podcasting, Jerod, is that we can sort of be influenced by the world, and share that back with BMC, and say "Please make similarities. Be inspired by x, and let's bring that into this." I feel like that's the ultimate way to remix the world. Everything's just a remix anyways... And I think it's less about "Let's have what they have", but more like "Man, that's so cool. Let's do versions of that to spread that version more into the world."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, they're using techniques or sounds or things that you can evolve on.

**Adam Stacoviak:** For sure.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Remix the world...! Yas.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Jerod Santo:** I love a bit of homage. So BMC, did you go to actually watch Tetris, or did you just go listen to some of the music and then say "Tetris Schmetris"?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, I didn't watch it... Although I'm watching it in my head overlaid over everything right now, because all you have to say is Tetris, and I'm trying to get lines together...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's very --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, but I listened to the theme song. I played it a lot. That's what I did.

**Jerod Santo:** And then this came out the other end right here.

**Sample**: \[28:50\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah, you definitely use this one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** See, that just begs for someone to start talking right there, doesn't it?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** I think so.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's good to know stuff like that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The second one is off by one beat, right? It's on the up.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:29:14.22\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Very cool.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The second sixteenth note, if you wanna be --

**Jerod Santo:** The second sixteenth, Adam,

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, exactly. Sorry about that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, I'm not correcting you. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I knew it was on the up though, at least.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, happy you notice it at all.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Still a track.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I believe the theme song uses the same sounds, and definitely the same BPM; that's like the first thing you can do to make a song sound like another song, is don't deviate from the BPM. The tempo.

**Jerod Santo:** I love that one. I love that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh... So good, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[29:49\] And it's kind of chill too, so it is begging for someone to talk over the top of it. I mean, some tracks where you're like "I love this track, but I couldn't use it as a bed, during a read, because it's just too much going on." Like, you're just gonna be fighting with it. But especially the first part of that is just very melodic and simple, and doesn't have a lot of craziness to it, and so you can just talk right over the top of it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:30:12.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's good. As BMC would say, "I like it. Maybe you would like it, too."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I do like it. I'm glad you like it, too.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was very happy with that track, though. Very, very happy with that track. When I heard it, I was like "You... You...! You...!! You knocked it out of the park. Oh my gosh, this is absolute fire. Give me more, turn it up! Go, go, go!

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Go, go, go! Excellent.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, for real. I'll pause for a second and just gush for one second, Jerod. Do you mind if I gush just a brief moment?

**Jerod Santo:** As long as we can clean up afterwards.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Seriously, working with you is so freakin awesome...! It really is. Just being able to be inspired by something, and share that with you, and then like something cool comes out the other end that is not just mostly good, it's like really good. To me it's the absolute magic of some of the stuff we do. Of the secret sauces, you're like -- I close the curtain, and I immediately shake the bottle you're in, and I pour you out all over the stuff we do, and then it's just amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, stop gushing. It's getting weird. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Little BMC... It's like BFF. You're like the BFF, man. You're the BMC BFF. So good. So good.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's hard to know how to respond to that specifically, but it's really nice. It's just very nice. \[laughter\] I don't have anything to say about my sauciness per se, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, the fact that you didn't just hang up and leave says a lot. It speaks volumes, BMC. You're still here, after that...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Feeling uncomfortable and need some more space...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You've got to illustrate things. You've gotta give people a mental picture.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, agreed. That was a picture. Absolutely.

**Jerod Santo:** Some pictures you don't have to give to people though. You could give other pictures. But BMC is still here, so he's here for it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, I'm here.

**Jerod Santo:** Speaking of making things extra special and sprinkling -- what did you say? I don't even know what you said. I tuned it out once it started getting weird... Gushing --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Just sprinkle you all over.

**Jerod Santo:** Sprinkle. Yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, in fact, I said "shook the bottle and pour you all over."

**Jerod Santo:** Right. It wasn't a sprinkle. That's why I stopped myself in --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Didn't you say draw the blinds first though?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I said close the curtain... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Close the curtain in the shower, BMC. He's taking a shower.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, no, it's the magician. It's the Great Oz. You can't see what's happening back here...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's my magic potions.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I thought you were taking a shower and the shampoo was just BMC, and you were spraying it...

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, this is like the Great Oz. Closing the curtain, you can't see what's back here... I've got magic things happening, and BMC is one of the bottles I grab and I shake, and I pour onto our podcasts.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so when you said paint a picture, you had painted a different picture in my head than you thought you were painting.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, that's because you've got a dirty mind. I can't help that, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** No, I have a clean mind. I thought you were taking a shower. Because you closed the curtain, and then you grabbed the bottle, and you start spraying it, and I figured you're just lathering up.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay, so let's get into this. Am I more shampoo or conditioner?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Neither.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Be brutally honest with me.

**Jerod Santo:** Brutally honest, I would say you're a conditioner. Because you go on second and make it all silky smooth, you know?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You're the three in one. You're the body wash, you're the shampoo, and you're the conditioner.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, my God.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's get back to the music, okay? Gosh.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Well, I think we're still talking about the music...

**Jerod Santo:** You made me remember that we haven't spoken to you since State of the 'log. Weren't you on the show prior to, or was it after?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Before, I think...

**Jerod Santo:** It was before, because people enjoyed that episode last year. Yeah. So we had Jamie Tanna on the show, and he had been a benefactor of your remixes. And so we talked about you with him, and what it felt like to receive a remix. But we haven't talked to you about what -- I mean you took State of the 'log to the next level this year.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That was fun.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[34:15\] See?

**Jerod Santo:** It was probably like three times better than usual, and we're gonna have to have you do it every year probably now.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Because I'm a three in one, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I want to do that. Let's do it every time. You're talking about cutting up people's messages into music, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the voicemails. So cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That was cool.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's like old school, when I was like a little kid and I had a radio and a double tape deck, and I'd just record certain words, and then mash them together on the second tape, and make the Muppets say horrible things, or something...

**Jerod Santo:** Right. That was amazing.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It was just fun.

**Jerod Santo:** So much so that I've been reusing those as transitions sometimes... Especially "Enjoy the drop", and a few other phrases that people said, that you then put music to.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Well, yeah, and they also said a bunch of perfect stuff.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, they were really nice. Couldn't have been happier. That almost makes me want to do more States of the 'logs, just so we can have more voicemails, more remixes... But you know, too much of a good thing can be too much.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Your listeners are cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, they are. Alright, back to Dance Party though... A couple of these tracks have names like they could be on a different album of ours; perhaps our Next Level album, because we have Tetris... And of course, there's Rainbow Toad Club; that sounds like it's a video game-inspired track. Ridley Gonna Ridley - I believe that's based off of Metroid, because Ridley is a character of Metroid, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's pretty old. That's a pretty old one for us, I think.

**Jerod Santo:** It is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Like several years old. Same with Sentient Refrigerator.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Because everyone knows what that sounds like.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That sounds scary to me. So remind me, BMC, why are some of these tracks on this album and not on Next Level, our video game theme-inspired ones?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You said why they're not...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Wouldn't those fit well over there? Do you remember why we didn't put them in that one?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Because Next Level was largely - although not entirely - trying to use just sounds from like a video game thing; like if it was a Nintendo Castlevania level... Which - you love Castlevania levels. Adam loves Castlevania levels.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I didn't want to add beats to it necessarily, like modern beats. It was just writing the whole thing using that.

**Jerod Santo:** Gotcha. Plus I guess we had Dance Party in mind even when we were making that one, so we probably held these back.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Right. So I kept most of the four to the floor... I kept that for later.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I have to say, my two favorite tracks on this one are the '80s, I don't know... Miami Bites 1984, and Pole Reposition.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sure.

**Jerod Santo:** Which I think was based off of Pole Position. That was a video game one. But very much sounds -- it sounds like it belongs in an '80s cars chase, or something.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I'm confused about that, because it's a video game, right? But the original song has rockin' studio guitar, kind of... No wait, what do I mean? Not studio.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's play a little bit of it here...

**Sample**: \[37:10\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** In-house musicians... Oh, I'm on the Highway to the Dangerzone already...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, there's a little Highway to the Dangerzone there... Which brings me to the '80s. Now, this does feel like a video game, like F0, or some sort of racing game... But even more so like Knight Rider maybe, Knight Rider vibes... I don't know. David Hasselhoff. It just makes me think of David Hasselhoff. As many things do.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** The level of cheese, yeah. I thought there was a guitar solo in this.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, this track is just awesome. I'll turn it off now, because I could listen to the whole thing, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[38:04\] Yeah. So there was several renditions of that on YouTube, and I've found one where -- and I think this is the one you actually was inspired by, was one that actually had like multiple instruments, I suppose. Like, the same person playing multiple instruments of the Pole Reposition, or Pole Position.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** One of those videos with all the mini screens inside it, where they're playing every --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, exactly.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I think it was something like that. So Pole Position was a popular game on Atari, I believe. Was it on Atari?

**Jerod Santo:** I thought it was on NES, but...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:38:37.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let me see.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It was definitely color graphics. I think it was Atari. Like the Joust days...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Released by Namco in '82 and licensed to Atari Inc.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That had to have been really advanced then, if it is the same time as Joust, around there... It was way more advanced.

**Jerod Santo:** So yeah, the Atari 2600 was the original. And I think it probably got remade onto other things... But yes, you got it right, Atari.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And I was just like "Let me just go back in my repertoire of games from old." And what were the themes? \[unintelligible 00:39:15.22\] was one of them... This one, obviously, and several others. Metroid, and Castlevania, and Sonic, and all the things.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Donkey Kong Country. A lot of those. Oh, I love doing the Sonic ones though. Those are too much fun. I've found the virtual instrument that is the same as the sound card they use for the Genesis, and it's just too good.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, nice.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. It's awesome.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I dug the theme remixes based on those. Those are cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, and those are on our theme songs album. The second half of the theme songs album is all Sonic remixes of the original theme songs. Which is almost more fun to listen to than the originals... Not that they're not good, they're just so much fun to listen to that second half.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's got nostalgia...

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's just no end to the goodness. The sauce just keeps coming.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you guys interested at all in? What the listeners are listening to?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Absolutely.

**Jerod Santo:** Well then...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Taylor Swift?

**Jerod Santo:** ...let sign into our account and see what -- oh no, two-step authentication... What happened here? Okay, BMC, stall for us...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, \[unintelligible 00:40:39.26\] Was that the bonus stage, with like the big sphere, where you had jump over the -- it doesn't matter. But I am stalling...

**Adam Stacoviak:** "But I am stalling..." \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** This sentence proves it as well.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Adam, stall for us.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was thinking about "Take on me" by A-ha, as a remix, in the future. It might be my favorite song ever.

**Jerod Santo:** Really?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah. If that song comes on, I'm happy.

**Jerod Santo:** Sure. But that's the only one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, there's many more, of course, but that's a really solid song.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** There are songs that just -- you're never sorry to hear it, ever.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, and that's one of them. I'll listen to it by Weezer, I'll listen to it by the original band, A-ha, of course... There's been many versions of -- there's an acapella version of it, that's really... It's probably 20 years after the original recording. It's just phenomenal. And the lyrics are not -- it's not just a good song, it's good lyrics too, in my opinion. They have meaning.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[41:46\] And then of course, back in the MTV days - I grew up in the '80s-'90s, so I want my MTV, basically. But the original music video - gosh... It was quintessential, of course. It was this real-life photography video mixed with cartoon... So cool. Have you seen it?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No. I'm picturing a different video. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What?! Oh my gosh, BMC. We have to steep you in my tastes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, please.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm gonna keep using cooking metaphors and verbs to describe things...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, I love cooking metaphors for music. You know what I learned to do? Is sautéed tomato paste on its own before you use it in something.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's really good. Maybe like spaghetti?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Or Indian food, particularly... But it transforms it a bit. Way better. Thank you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** How much do we have to stall here, Jerod?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, we're still stalling, right...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you're still stalling? I thought you were just talking.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was stalling.

**Jerod Santo:** Haah!

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You know what version of that I've heard most recently? There's a kid on Spotify replacing the lyrics to make it about Minecraft, and like practically swallowing the microphone... It's just so distorted, and that's immediately what I think of when you say "Take on me", and that's probably a shame.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh. Well, that's just sad...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I'm sorry...

**Adam Stacoviak:** We'll have to fix that...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's stop stalling. It's getting sad. Okay, so on Spotify at least, our most popular song, which maybe this is good timing for you to go there, Adam, is "Paul Oakenfold fights Moby in the alley behind a pan-Asian restaurant." That's our top song on Spotify.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm just saying...

**Jerod Santo:** Over the last month. Not all-time. Their all-time stats - it seemed to be not working for me, so that's why...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It totally makes sense to me.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Were you suggesting that Moby would win? Because I just don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Was I suggesting...?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, at the beginning you were like "Sorry for Paul... Let's feel sorry for Paul, but I feel like Moby's a vegan..."

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you know how I feel, BMC, because my original title was "Paul Oakenfold beats up Moby."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, that's true. Yeah, yeah. I tried to soften it somewhat...

**Jerod Santo:** And you changed it to be more politically correct...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... How do we always end up almost blasting Moby? This happened the last interview, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that was like a therapy session. "Tell us why you don't like Moby..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, this is why I think you came up with this, was because of that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, this came out our last episode together, because we were talking about how we would give you ridiculous requests, and you would fulfill them. And then shortly thereafter - and we also talked about your disdain for Moby; that's tongue in cheek...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I feel like I avoid it...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. And then afterwards, you're like "Hey, maybe we should put a few new tracks on Dance Party. Maybe we should make some more songs."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Definitely.

**Jerod Santo:** And you took requests. And I just tried to think of the most ridiculous thing I could.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You did, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Because I was trying to challenge you.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You did very well.

**Jerod Santo:** And the other one I requested didn't actually get made. I can't remember what it was. It had something to do with Andre 3000... But this one got made. And I just said "I want you to write a song called "Paul Oakenfold beats up Moby in the alley behind a sushi restaurant." Now, you refused to do that, but you agreed to write one that's very similar. No, you didn't refuse. Well, we just renamed it over time.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I changed it to pan-Asian, because it uses a lot of Shaw Brothers Kung Fu samples... Which is not Japanese.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. So it was a very nice touch there, a nice detail that I would have missed.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Let's get it correct.

**Jerod Santo:** And you also wanted to say "Paul Oakenfold fights Moby", versus "Beats up Moby." Which I'm fine with.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... I don't know. I felt bad for Moby, I guess...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... I think a lot of people pick on Moby.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Right. I don't need to be -- yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Like, once Eminem did it, pretty much -- it was open season on Moby. Don't you think, Adam?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I didn't know Eminem did that, but I've always been a Moby fan, I guess. Not like a deep fan...

**Jerod Santo:** I like Moby's music.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You like that album Play.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Agreed. That's pretty much the one that I know.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's good.

**Jerod Santo:** But do you remember that Eminem track, when he dissed Moby?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, that's right. Yeah, I do recall that. And lyrically, he dissed him. Not in an interview. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it was a track.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The way true rappers diss is via tracks, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. But he didn't just like call him a dweeb, or something. He's like "Nobody listens to Moby." He came out and said that, like "You know no one listens to Moby."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Was that the same one who was mentioning Britney Spears?

**Jerod Santo:** \[46:11\] I think so.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That was back when Eminem could do nothing but drop fire every album, every track.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think it was The Real Slim Shady, is the track...

**Jerod Santo:** Quite possibly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Because that was the one he was like -- yeah, I think so.

**Jerod Santo:** Anyways. So ever since then, people have been picking on Moby. I do like some of Moby's music, I don't have any problem with the guy. I don't even know him. But I thought it'd be funny that Paul Oakenfold beat him up in a song title. That's all.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's all.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Regardless, this is what came out. So from that request, I didn't give you any more information. I just gave you that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And you went and came up with this.

**Sample**: \[46:47\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's the Paul Oakenfold bit, for sure.

**Jerod Santo:** That definitely has Paul Oakenfold written all over it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, the Moby bit uses the line from Porcelain... "And this is goodbye...", which has the little four notes. Five notes...

**Jerod Santo:** So that's a nod to Moby. And then there's like Kung Fu noises.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Love that stuff.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's it.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I like that. I like that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** "This is goodbye."

**Jerod Santo:** This is a good song.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Thanks.

**Jerod Santo:** In fact, when I first listened to it, I thought "He's doing the Kung Fu noises because of the song title, but I wonder if he doesn't even need them, and maybe they're distracting." But then I got used to them and I like them now, so I got over it... But I wonder what other people think about that.

**Jerod Santo:** See, I like them now, but at first I was like "Huh..."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, it could be too far. It makes it very --

**Jerod Santo:** But it makes me actually visualize a fight.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It just sounds good. It's punctuation. I don't know. It's nice rhythmically... But it doesn't fit with Changelog in any way... Thematically... I think...

**Jerod Santo:** True. And I don't think we use it for anything... \[laughs\] Except for this.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Because yeah, I don't think I would put this into an episode necessarily.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Where are you gonna find a matching context for those...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** An outro.

**Jerod Santo:** An outro, or something where -- maybe a debate episode, you know?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay, sure...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it definitely was just a fun diversion, and just a... It's just here for the Dance Party.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm all about a fun diversion.

**Jerod Santo:** And the kids on Spotify seem to like it, more than other stuff, at least.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I have some good news about this track... Good news that you didn't even know.

**Jerod Santo:** What's that?

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is brand new information, straight from Spotify's API... When you search for "Paul Oakenfold", under tracks, which lists the songs that reference or are attached to Paul Oakenfold, this track comes up as 234. Now, I believe Moby has somehow gamed the algorithm, because it is nowhere in existence in Moby's search.

**Jerod Santo:** It turns out lots of people do listen to Moby.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is he still doing stuff? You know, I don't care. Anyway...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It doesn't matter.

**Jerod Santo:** "You know, I don't care. Don't answer that."

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is your shirt a Godfather thing? I can only see the very top, but the font looks Godfathery.

**Jerod Santo:** Me?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's the Changelog. This is the old school Changelog.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's nice.

**Jerod Santo:** The original.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The OG.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Have we got a favorite song?

**Jerod Santo:** From this album, or overall?

**Adam Stacoviak:** On this whole album.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I shared mine. "Miami bites" and "Pole reposition" are the two. I probably couldn't pick from those two.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I mean, I think I like -- I do like "Bump on a Log." I'm really boring, but... I like the Orange Night.

**Jerod Santo:** The Orange Night's so deep in the tracklist that I don't always get to it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... \[unintelligible 00:50:05.20\]

**Sample**: \[50:09\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, this one could have been like what Bump on a Log is almost.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it could have opened up, too.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Close, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It takes a little long to get to --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, I like Bump better.

**Jerod Santo:** I do, too.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I don't know, this has got to be one you can't really talk over either. Why do you let me keep doing this?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, you know, some of them are just good, and we can't stop you, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** Not all of our music needs to be talked over either.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, that's true. Not everything's a bumper, I realized, but...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't like to resist art, honestly. I like to just let it flow.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I like that about you.

**Adam Stacoviak:** My favorite is Dusk Under a Flaming Moon.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that's a good one, too.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's the same style as Jerod's favorite.

**Jerod Santo:** It is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** In particular the middle section of it gets really good. You've gotta listen to it for a bit to get there though.

**Jerod Santo:** This is a longer track. It's almost three minutes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, it's just -- you could talk over this one, no problem.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. This also feels like I'm driving at nighttime.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. It's an adventure.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Driving at nighttime, and it's really saturated neon pink and purple in my head.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** Like Tron almost...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sure. I'm always thinking of that movie Drive. It had that song Night Call in it that was cool.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Drive was a good movie.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, this track is awesome.

**Adam Stacoviak:** When this guitar solo comes in though, I'm just thinking like you just grabbed the guitar and did this somehow. But the strings made the solo coming up. Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you grab your guitar and make this happen?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right here.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, those noises?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Like, this is an awesome solo. It's the only reason to listen to the whole song. This is it right here. This right here. This moment.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I don't know if that was a guitar, honestly. It has that feeling though, doesn't it?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, it does, now that I think about it. I haven't thought about it that hard until now. It does kind of feel like a guitar. Or some crazy...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:52:44.20\]

**Jerod Santo:** I think if you did play our live show, you should probably do this one on the guitar...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I can't play guitar... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** What?!

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I mean, a little bit. Sometimes I need like acoustic guitar chords, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Don't ruin our dreams, BMC.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, sorry. No, I'll learn for you, obviously.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[unintelligible 00:53:06.25\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... That's the best track of the whole album, in my opinion. That's it.

**Jerod Santo:** It is good. Well, what are you working on now? What should we do next? What's cookin'? What's poppin'? What's breakin' and poppin'?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Wow... So many questions.

**Jerod Santo:** It's all the same question.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's true.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** How do I break this down between --

**Jerod Santo:** I was stalling.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That was very good. What am I doing? That's a podcast theme. That's a podcast theme. That's the thing I really want to talk about, but cannot.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh. That's a podcast theme.

**Jerod Santo:** We're making podcast themes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Working on a video game that teaches kids how to play piano. Just really cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Nice. That's cool.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Writing a book...

**Jerod Santo:** You're writing a book?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, which is like the most horrible thing someone can say to you... Because you're like "No, you're not. You're really not." And then you're like "I have to act like I'm interested in someone's book." But it's true.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm interested that you're writing a book, not necessarily in the book... Unless you tell me what it's about and I get interested, but... That's kind of interesting.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[54:16\] I won't do that to you, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, don't do that to us.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Music theory? Beat matching?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No... It's like Nancy Drew, if everyone was really worried what was wrong with Nancy Drew.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like Nancy Drew on drugs?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, but not literally. But yeah. I was informed the other day that my main character is completely insane, and I hadn't actually realized that. I thought she was just dedicated, and...

**Jerod Santo:** You though she was just dedicated... Well, that's interesting. So who's reading this book of yours and giving you feedback?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You know, people floating about...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** "You know...

**Jerod Santo:** The Mysterious. This is why we say The Mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** "People floating about."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Always a surprise with you.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it? Well, now I wanna be more surprising, though I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well, I mean, the fact that you're writing a book and you're just letting people who float about read it is a surprise.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I mean, I know the people...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Here, read this!"

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm on street corners, being like "Hold on!!"

**Adam Stacoviak:** "Be surprised."

**Jerod Santo:** You're like "Is this main character too dedicated, or what do you think?"

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, right. Right.

**Jerod Santo:** So it's a mystery.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's a series of mysteries.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, wow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It has to be. \[unintelligible 00:55:24.13\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I know. I'm just trying to tease here.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** She goes around solving mysteries, but writes down details that have no bearing on anything, and starts freaking out about spiders, and has a group of first-graders that she uses to do her detective work, and runs screaming through the streets, and lies to everyone, all the time... It's like the best book I've ever heard, now that I say that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it doesn't sound bad, actually...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What age is Nancy Drew in this book you're writing?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, 36.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Wow. Okay.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** But none of this actually matters. Like, it does, but there's an overarching thing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh my gosh, this is actually like a gold mine here.

**Jerod Santo:** I kind of want to read this now.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Me too.

**Jerod Santo:** How do we float about in your area?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You are floating about in my area.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Let's get a manuscript.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, gosh. Are you gonna publish this?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, actually... I have someone who will read it and consider representing. An agent.

**Jerod Santo:** Awesome. What's the deadline? Uh-oh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** How does this work? Can you write? Do you have to get like the rights to Nancy Drew though, to publish a book about --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, it's not really Nancy Drew. It's just -- she solves mysteries, and is apparently insane.

**Jerod Santo:** You're just characterizing it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, \[unintelligible 00:56:41.16\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I see. Well, that's actually interesting.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm glad.

**Adam Stacoviak:** In a way.

**Jerod Santo:** "In a way..." \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** From some angle...

**Jerod Santo:** He almost gave you a compliment...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's interesting about it is that Nancy Drew was a teen in the book series, right?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I guess so, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And she ultimately grew up and had things happen in her life when she went to college, and... So the story arc of Nancy Drew follows Nancy Drew's growing up, in a way.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like you're just reading ChatGPT responses to us at this point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I'm not. I'm very familiar with Nancy Drew. Very familiar.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm not, honestly, but --

**Jerod Santo:** I just \[unintelligible 00:57:16.17\] a young female detective, or mystery solver. That's as far as I went.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Life is full of mystery.

**Jerod Santo:** True.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And then she's 36 now, or 37, as you said. I mean, that to me is like --

**Jerod Santo:** It's not actually Nancy Drew though, Adam. He was just giving us something to hang \[unintelligible 00:57:33.12\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just trying to pin back to Nancy. I mean, that's the hook.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, please. Anything you know about Nancy Drew... It'd probably just help me \[unintelligible 00:57:41.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** Does this pin back to Nancy?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, he said so. It's like a Nancy Drew.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's a series of mysteries. There's a spider that keeps repeating. You're like "Why is the spider repeating?"

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Is this like a real spider, like a monster, is it --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's a real spider.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So it's plausible fiction.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. There's an actual reason for it, but everything appears supernatural. It's the case of the repeating spider, and then the mystery of the missing missing arm.

**Jerod Santo:** \[58:07\] Ah. And what's your intended audience age? Like, is this for adults? It this for young adults? Is this for children?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I swear a lot... A lot. Otherwise kids could read it.

**Jerod Santo:** Could you release two editions, one for everybody?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I've actually thought about that... Because I would enjoy reading this aloud to some kids.

**Jerod Santo:** So why is your protagonist an insane person?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I didn't know she was insane... She's me to a very large extent.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, okay. Interesting. I mean, I would definitely -- I would read this.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm gonna send you one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** No, don't be sorry.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Don't apologize yet. Wait till I read it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. I had to research social security fraud a lot for this.

**Jerod Santo:** Don't give us hints, man. I want the mystery to be fresh. I don't want to have any sort of preconceived notions now. I can't imagine a world in which a repeating spider would have a natural explanation, so I'm very curious.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Even better is this is something that happened to me. It's not even like -- there was a repeating spider and I couldn't figure out why it was repeating, and then I found out, and it blew my mind.

**Jerod Santo:** Wow.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't understand repeating spider. Like, literally?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, I'm just being vague...

**Jerod Santo:** You kept seeing the same spider?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** There's a dead spider on the second floor of a building, and I flicked it down to the first floor, and then later it was there again... And I was like "Spiders are not supposed to repeat."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I see.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you think it was maybe a glitch in the Matrix \[unintelligible 00:59:33.14\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Right. And she really doesn't like glitches in the matrix. She wants everything to be orderly, and make sense, or she loses her mind. And in this case, there's a reason.

**Jerod Santo:** Love it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It could be the mimic.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** What's the mimic?

**Adam Stacoviak:** And the blood from the mimic. That was the premise for Tom Cruise's movie with Emily Blunt, Live Die Repeat.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Edge of Tomorrow. One of the best science fiction movies ever.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I remember that one being really good, actually.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Definitely up there in my list.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah? What other sci-fi movies do you like?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... Probably my favorite of all --

**Jerod Santo:** Don't say Tenet.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Don't say Prime.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Prime?

**Jerod Santo:** Primer?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, Prime. Oh, is it Primer? The low-budget time machine --

**Jerod Santo:** A low-budget time machine is called Primer, but it's spelled Primer.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, my bad.

**Jerod Santo:** It's alright.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, but you can answer the question. We're just shouting the bad movies...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's not even a bad movie.

**Jerod Santo:** He's thinking...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, there's just a list. I mean, it's a nonstop list.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Give us a top five.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Interstellar, Tenet, Ready Player One, Dune... What's the movie -- Blade Runner 2049?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, that was good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** OG Blade Runner, of course...

**Jerod Santo:** Five. Are you gonna count that as one, Blade Runner and --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, they're together, basically...

**Jerod Santo:** Sure.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm impressed anybody who could pick up that franchise and make a movie \[unintelligible 01:00:58.16\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that was a solid film there.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** He also did the Dune movies you like. Same director.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. Well, basically, anything Christopher Nolan does, I will watch. That was not the obviously director of that one, but I'll watch anything from him. And oddly enough - this is not this is not science fiction, this is more horror...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's just a different category.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah... I'm just looking at my list.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Well, let's see. There might be some genre blending.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's hear it. Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is what they say "They're all going to laugh at you", in that funny voice, from the movies... Megan, honestly. It's a really interesting AI present day horror movie.

**Jerod Santo:** I never saw it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's an okay plot.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You know what's an incredible sci-fi horror movie? Annihilation.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh my gosh, yes. The best. The song in there from Hall & Oates in there though? I mean, just stellar. On point.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I think it's Hall & Oates.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** There's a lot of like folk music, like folk guitar, which is really unnerving, for some reason... And the ending music, where - I won't give anything away, but Natalie Portman --

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:02:03.15\] Oh, my gosh. The music is so good.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** ...the space melon... That will haunt me until I die. That is incredible.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. You have to come to my house and watch it, because that's where it's the best...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You said theater. Do you have a theater?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I have a theater in my house... And you'll love it. I'm trying to find the song... There's a song that I'm trying to think of what it is. It's worth it. It's when he comes back, and he's come up the stairs; that song. And she's painting.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, in the beginning. Yeah. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. That song.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** You know far more about Hall & Oates than I do.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't actually think it's Hall & Oates. That's why I'm really curious if I'm wrong, because I don't think it is... But I'm a big fan of Annihilation. I own it on 4k. If I own it on 4k, I love the movie. That's just how it works.

**Jerod Santo:** Let me name a few sci-fi movies that didn't make your list, which maybe you'll have to add them as I say them... Because you left off some pretty good movies, although you can't name just five. Who can do that...? But for instance, you left off Terminator II, you left off The Matrix, you left off Aliens... You left off the original Planet of the Apes...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** These are ones that just go without saying, because they're just so --

**Jerod Santo:** Kind of. But I've said them. There's a few you left off the list... How about this one - Minority Report.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That was an early movie obsession of mine. That was so good.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that was a good one. Spielberg.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... I was so off. Sorry. Crosby, Stills and Nash. Helplessly Hoping. I mean, the harmony... Sorry to interrupt, Jerod. The harmony of those folks singing that track...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** They have good harmony.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So good.

**Jerod Santo:** What's the track called?

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's called Helplessly Hoping. Pull it up on Spotify. Helplessly Hoping. And play it for us.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, give me a second. Stall them, BMC...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay... \[gargling 01:04:02.22\] I tried to make it through that. Gargling solo.

**Jerod Santo:** A for effort.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Thank you.

**Helplessly Hoping:** \[01:04:17.06\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It was so good. Such a good track.

**Jerod Santo:** The harmonizing is where it's at, you're right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is the only real track, like real song in the whole movie. Everything else is made for this movie soundtrack.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's like acoustic guitar, which is totally opposite what's happening on the screen, and it feels good... And then there's the space melon music, which is terrifying.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Space melon.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, when Natalie Portman gazes into the melon.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Actually, how about this? We'll come out of this show with a prescription. The prescription is to go rewatch Annihilation, or pick your favorite scene; the ending scene, when everybody gets enveloped... And make a space melon song for us. Those bass beats...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Those bass notes?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, we'll have to suck in the audience into this one. That's what will happen.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** How terrifying does your show ever get, though, really?

**Adam Stacoviak:** It might have to get a little scary... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... We're gonna have to start fear-mongering. You know, "The AI is coming...! It's gonna envelop all of us!!" I mean, people are kind of afraid right now, honestly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, are they really?

**Jerod Santo:** I think so.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Just in general, or AI?

**Jerod Santo:** Software developers. Our livelihoods are potentially at stake. People are getting laid off, they're getting told that they're going to be replaced by machines... I mean, I think that if there was a time of fear in the software developer community, this is probably the highest it's been.

**Adam Stacoviak:** True.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Because there hasn't really been a reason to be afraid of anything, besides maybe the y2k bug.

**Adam Stacoviak:** But not because of our podcast, though. They're not necessarily scared because of our shows.

**Jerod Santo:** Not yet...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I wasn't suggesting you were causing the fear... You discuss the fear, you don't actively terrorize people.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:06:11.09\] We don't fear-monger, no. Not yet. Not until we have the soundtrack.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, God...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, so to go back... I did not mention The Matrix, I'm sorry. That is on my list on 4k. I was going with more modern, I suppose...

**Jerod Santo:** No, it's all good. We've put you on the spot. I mean, there's too many good movies to just name five...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, gosh. I mean, just so many. So many good movies.

**Jerod Santo:** But yeah, The Matrix and Minority Report - I guess they also were kind of coming out when I was coming of age, and so those stick in my head as just very -- The Matrix is probably the most influential sci-fi movie I've ever seen, where I still think about it...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ex Machina.

**Jerod Santo:** Ex Machina is good. I liked that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That's the Annihilation gut, too. Everything he does is disturbing as heck.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that is disturbing. I am a fan of The Matrix, obviously, and I'm a big fan of Minority Report. I think that was a movie ahead of its time, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** For sure. You know what was good? Looper. Did you guys see Looper?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good one. I mean, maybe not top five, but good.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I mean, if there's a time travel movie out there, I'm gonna watch it. And that's not like your typical time travel movie, but there's time involved. And it's really interesting.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I would say that I kind of get -- I get mad at time travel movies, because it's so hard to do well, and to do right... And there's always problems... But Looper actually has a pretty good consistency to it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, they don't bother explaining the mechanism too much, which I like.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. Like, it's not the main point. It's just there.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's like a small little story, really.

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It just -- it also happens to be true that you can --

**Jerod Santo:** Which - you kind of have to do that, because the more you make it about the time travel, the more you think about it, the more the concepts break down, you know?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's still parts of Tenet I cannot understand, to this day.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Are we sure that's a good movie?

**Jerod Santo:** Which to me is a sign of a bad movie.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 01:08:03.22\] that's a good movie. I might pour you out into the trash.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...!

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, no...! My sauce!

**Jerod Santo:** Don't speak against The Tenet. I agree, I watched it, I did not understand it, and then I went through the podcast with our heavy spoilers friend and Adam, and we talked about it... And I came out thinking, "I don't need to think about that movie ever again." Like, it doesn't really --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Really? What a shame, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** Nah. There's so many things to think about.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Aren't there a lot of plot twists that are obvious from the first second of the movie? That's what I seem to remember.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'm not here to rag on your movie you like...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's too deep to go into. It's got a lot of layers. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever, but it's definitely -- when you compare time travel movies of all time travel movies, in my opinion, that movie will go down in history as one of the most difficult to pull off, and a masterpiece, when compared to time travel movies. As a movie and plot, not absolutely the best movie ever... But really well done with time. Like, you can't deny that from that movie.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I value your opinion and assessment.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, it's solid. I mean, they did a great job with it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I'll watch it again, because if you like it... Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Even from a shooting standpoint, a cinematography standpoint, it's super-well done. A lot of detail.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, he's a good filmmaker. I keep wanting something to top Inception, but I feel like that was --

**Jerod Santo:** Inception was great.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I feel like that movie gets ragged on a bit, but that was my favorite Nolan probably.

**Jerod Santo:** I liked it a lot. Well, Memento for me is still his best, but...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Talk about good execution on a good idea... I mean, that was a good idea that's hard to pull off, and he pulled it off well.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Seriously.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** That should be too hard to keep track of when you're watching it, but you could just barely hold the thread...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I mean, you can follow it though. They do a good job of just pulling you along.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:10:03.20\] At the end though there's no resolution. You're kind of just like where you began, in a way.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah... There's a realization.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, I mean no resolution. There's a realization, of course. You realize what's happening. But there's no resolution to the challenge that he's dealing with as a character. Like, you're just gonna keep repeating.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And you kind of feel bad for him, because it's perpetual. It's not going to end.

**Jerod Santo:** Spoiler alert, by the way...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, I don't think we spoiled anything, really. We just --

**Jerod Santo:** You just spoiled the end.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** He's totally screwed...

**Jerod Santo:** You just said there's no resolution. He's gonna continue to live on with it.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That doesn't describe anything though.

**Jerod Santo:** If you watch the first 15 minutes, now you know what the problem is, and then you remember what Adam said, and now you know that the solution doesn't happen.

**Adam Stacoviak:** But you don't know the details...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm gonna drop a spoiler horn, is my point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, drop a spoiler horn.

**Jerod Santo:** I will.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's fine with me.

**Jerod Santo:** That's all.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We need a mini spoiler horn, because they're not always big spoiler horns.

**Jerod Santo:** That reminds me, BMC made our spoiler horn for us.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I know.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Did I?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you did. You made us seven spoiler horns. \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Play that spoiler horn, Jerod. Can you play it?

**Jerod Santo:** I think I only use one of them...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Like a klaxon, or like a horn?

**Jerod Santo:** No, we wanted it to be like a -- it's almost like here comes steamboat... I actually can't play it right now, because I'm dialed in a different soundboard. But you'll remember it when you hear it. It kind of sounds like "Here comes a giant freight boat." You know, it's gonna hit a bridge.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And there's like a stutter out.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Is it a fog horn?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, kind of like a fog horn.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay, yes, I remember those. I forgot that was the purpose.

**Jerod Santo:** And then there's stutter-outs, there's some non-tutter-outs... You just gave us different iterations.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah, that sounds right.

**Jerod Santo:** Anyway, you make so much music and sounds in your life you can't even remember. But you've never made a book. Is this your first book?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** \[laughs\] Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** So exciting. What inspired you to write a book? Why did you decide to do this?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** What the book is actually about is nothing I've hinted at, and I just had an idea like 10 years ago, and it's just been mulling in my head... And if I have an idea that sticks with me at least like three months, I will finally just do it. And this was a little more complicated, so it took 10 years.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It's just, anything I'm obsessed with, then I'm obsessed with it. I do this all the time. I can't focus on anything but it when I'm walking around, so it just happens.

**Jerod Santo:** Love it. It's like a repeat spider, you know? You just can't get rid of it.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yup. Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** It just keeps coming back.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Can't flick it away. I know.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, BMC... Well, if this episode of our podcast was an airplane in flight - I'm drawing a picture now - how would you as the captain of said airplane, how would you land this plane gracefully?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I don't know how to fly a plane.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** So sorry both of you...

**Jerod Santo:** Do you know how to end a conversation? Because I fairly don't either.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, I don't know to --

**Jerod Santo:** You just make music and books, and you let us land podcast planes.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Yeah. Let neurotypical people --

**Jerod Santo:** We're typical people?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** No, neurotypical people. Let them end conversations.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I see. I couldn't hear what you said.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Do your audience identify as autistic, would you say, largely?

**Jerod Santo:** Would our audience identify? Well, we can't identify a collective, you know?

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Fair.

**Jerod Santo:** But I'm sure there's probably autistic people in our audience, as there are probably --

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** I feel like the people that I know who are programmers...

**Jerod Santo:** There's definitely a higher percentage, I believe, of overlap there. I think \[unintelligible 01:13:28.02\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam, you're neurotypical, I think. I don't know what that means exactly every time... But can you land this podcast plane?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can. And I will.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I will land it by saying 1, 2, 3, 4. You are now in my trance, and this is the end of the podcast.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just kidding! That was actually a good line... You have lyrics in this one. Drum and Space. I'll leave with that. Because that to me is probably one of the best recent beats you've made, in my opinion.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Oh, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, Drum and Space was pretty awesome. Have you seen this one yet, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** I think so. Does it say 1, 2, 3, 4?

**Adam Stacoviak:** It does say that.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Those are some lyrics, man...

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 01:14:10.02\]

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** It took me about four seconds to write.

**Jerod Santo:** I love that one. I would use that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I mean, it's just the best. It's the best.

**Jerod Santo:** So we're gonna end it with that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. This is the new outro track for this track, at least. We'll end this show with Drum and Space.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Okay. Beautiful.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So bye. Thank you, BMC, for being the Mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder, the beats freak in residence, the ultimate beatmaker of all time, the sauce I pour on all my favorite podcasts...

**Jerod Santo:** The conditioner that we put on our episodes...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You special three in one you... Oh, my gosh. Shake you up and pour you out.

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Thanks, everybody...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Bye, friends...

**Breakmaster Cylinder:** Bye!
