**Jerod Santo:** Hello, world. We are back with another Frontend Feud for your enjoyment. Returning champs return - that's what champs do, they return - to defend their title. It's Adam and Una from the CSS Podcast. Welcome back, y'all.

**Adam Argyle:** What's up?!

**Una Kravets:** Hello!

**Jerod Santo:** How are you feeling today? Are you feeling cheeky? Are you feeling like winners? Are you feeling like you're gonna defend, are you going to lose? What's gonna happen?

**Una Kravets:** Third time's a charm, baby. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Argyle:** I feel like Rocky hanging on the cliff with one finger, and I'm like "I got this... I think."

**Una Kravets:** Yeah. I don't know how we won two in a row.

**Jerod Santo:** Cliffhanger reference. Old school. Does Rocky hang from the cliff, or is it just Sylvester Stallone?

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, that's a good point.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a question that will remain unanswered. Oh, we answered it. Those men laughing, but not yet talking, because I haven't allowed it yet, are our contenders. It's Robbie the Wagner, and Charles III - I'll let him finish it - from Whiskey Web and Whatnot. What's up, guys?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Thanks for having us, Richard Dawson. \[laughter\]

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, do we get a kiss now? That was the '70s version...

**Jerod Santo:** My name is Jerod Santo, I will be your host today... And we're excited, because this is a chance for a 3P. The first time in Frontend Feud history we have a chance for a 3P. Now, for our last feud I had Larry the intern write some icebreaker questions. Unfortunately, those questions were so bad that he's no longer with us. \[laughter\] Well, he's no longer interning with us. He's... Yeah, fired.

**Adam Argyle:** Can you fire AI? I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** So I asked our new intern, Terry, to check out your guys's profiles and write a fun question for each of you, which I will read for the first time now. Okay, here I have a question for Robbie. You are a self-professed Ember.js and Tailwind fanboy. When are you going to grow up and become a fan man? \[laughter\]

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I don't know. I think probably never.

**Jerod Santo:** Alrighty. Let's turn to you, Chuck. Your name is Chuck Carpenter, but your enemies call you, Charles William Carpenter the Third. This begs the question, what is your third-favorite wood that you use for carpentry, Bill?

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm a big pine fan.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. Good answer. Una Kravets. Una, you recently introduced the popover API to the world at Google IO. What you didn't introduce was a popover blocker API. Coincidence?

**Una Kravets:** \[laughs\] I wish.

**Jerod Santo:** And last and least, Adam Argyle. Adam, as a large language model, I don't have opinions on Argyle's -- Terry, you are so fired! I said "No, AI, you're out of here." Let's just play this game, shall we? \[laughter\]

We're here to play Frontend Feud. This is the game where our contestants don't try to be smart and correct, they try to be smart and match what our audience said. As we surveyed 100 JS Party listeners, we asked them various questions about technology, about developer life, and we saw what they answered. We grouped them together and we created a game board, which lists the top answers that were grouped.

Now, you had to have an answer repeat five times to actually make the board, so any answer less than five isn't on the board. The top answers are on the board. And our teams will take turns trying to match those answers. The team with the most points at the end wins. Are there any questions?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Nah...

**Jerod Santo:** I should point out one wrinkle in the rules is that each round begins with an interface-off (that's a pun), and after the interface-off, whoever gets the highest match during that time, their team gets to play that round. They then get to guess repeatedly until they have three misses. After three misses, the other team can steal; they get one guess, they have to match the board to steal. You can confer at that time. You cannot confer while you're just doing your regular guessing. And if you steal, you steal all the points for that round. Makes sense? Alright, let's get our game board up...

**Adam Argyle:** I feel pressure...

**Jerod Santo:** Let me know when you can see the Frontend Feud gameboard.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Let's see... Yes.

**Robbie Wagner:** Yup.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, that's us.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, here we are. And ladies first, so we'll start with Una, and she'll be going against Chuck in our very first interface-off.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Wait, where's my buzzer?

**Una Kravets:** Oh, we don't buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** There's no buzzer. We take turns, because latency problems... So we will just be taking turns. This will be Una versus Chuck. Una, we asked 100 JS Party listeners "What is your most favorite programming language?" The top five answers are on the board. What do you think they said?

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna have to go with JavaScript on this one...

**Jerod Santo:** Is JavaScript on the board? \[win alert\] Yes, of course it is. But the twist ending... It's in point number two. So JavaScript is indeed on the board, but it's only their second-favorite programming language, which means, Chuck, you get a chance to answer. If you can match that top spot, you and Robbie get to play this round.

**Chuck Carpenter:** This could be interesting... I feel like it's a trick answer for the first one then... These were JS Party people who were surveyed...

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Chuck Carpenter:** ...so I'm gonna pick TypeScript.

**Jerod Santo:** I can't believe this could possibly be the case... Is TypeScript the most popular programming language amongst JS Party listeners? \[win alert\] It absolutely is. Number one spot, TypeScript... Which to me is just proof that Nick Nisi stuffed the ballots, and answered the majority of these responses were all Nick, with different names, like Rick Nisi, Chick Nisi, Flick Nisi... Stuff like that.

\[05:56\] Nonetheless, the Whatnots have it. So one and two are gone. Chuck and Robbie will be playing this round... And we have three, four and five left on the board. Fellas, you've got to match all three of those, and you take home all of round one's point. Let's go down to Robbie, it's your turn. What is our listeners' most favorite programming language?

**Robbie Wagner:** I'm gonna go with Rust.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Rust. \[win alert\] It's on there. Number four answer, with seven responses. Very good. Alright, Charles, back to you.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm gonna pick... I'm a little torn between two. We can't confer, so I'm just gonna pick Golang.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Golang. \[fail alert\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** It's my last serious answer... Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, but Golang did not make the top five. Robbie, your turn.

**Robbie Wagner:** How about Ruby?

**Jerod Santo:** Is Ruby one of the most favorite languages of our listeners? \[win alert\] Number three, with eight respondents naming Ruby. So we have one through four matched. That's TypeScript, JavaScript, Ruby and Rust. The fifth one's still on the board. You have one strike, so two more chances before the chance to steal. We go back to you, Chuck.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm going to pick PHP.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us PHP. \[fail alert\] Oh, strike two. So far Robbie is carrying the team...

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, no, I'm gonna lose it for us here...

**Jerod Santo:** And Charles is proving that he's not in charge. Alright, Robbie, here we go... Match that number five spot and you guys take home round one points. There's already 69 points on the board.

**Robbie Wagner:** I have no idea... I'm going to assume that this is like a weird one, that's not really a programming language, so I'm gonna say HTML.

**Jerod Santo:** For round one and the board, is HTML the fifth most favorite programming language of our listeners? \[fail alert\] It is not. I am so sorry, but you guys missed thrice. So our opportunity to steal - Adam and Una, you can now confer amongst yourselves. You have to match that fifth spot. You match it, and you steal it. What do you think?

**Una Kravets:** Okay, we've got one shot...

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah. What are your guesses? I've got one left on my list.

**Una Kravets:** I have two thoughts. My first thought is maybe Python, because people like Python a lot. And there's some web coordination. I don't know if that's this audience necessarily, so I'm not sure about that one. But my second guess is what if people just said none? \[laughs\]

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, yeah, that was a tricky thing about last time...

**Jerod Santo:** It was quite the conundrum.

**Adam Argyle:** I have Python on my list as well. You know, my heart says CSS, and I'm with Robbie there --

**Una Kravets:** Mine too.

**Adam Argyle:** ... with HTML. It's obviously up there as well. But I think Python's our strongest guess.

**Una Kravets:** But I don't think they said CSS. \[laughter\] I think it's Python. Let's go with that.

**Adam Argyle:** Alright. Python. PiePie. Show me. I'm hungry, I need some pie.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, to steal round one, and to prove why they are two-time champs - is Python on the board? \[win alert\] They got it. Number five answer, Python.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, y'all. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** That is a successful round.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah... I really thought it was going to be CSS, to be honest.

**Adam Argyle:** That would have made my heart happy.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we should mention a few of our noteworthy contenders... Like I said, five votes or more, you don't make the board. CSS got three, so it was right there...

**Una Kravets:** We've gotta get more CSS on your show.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I think so, too. Java got two votes, and someone confirmed they were not joking, as part of their vote. HTML only got one, but it was not zilch, like many other languages were... So not bad, but 75 points are going to the CSS Podcast, and we turn now to round two.

This will be Adam versus Robbie in the interface-off. We will start with Robbie. This time, on the flip side, what is your least favorite programming language? There are six spots on the board. Robbie, you get to guess first.

**Robbie Wagner:** Let's say Java.

**Jerod Santo:** \[10:00\] Show us Java. \[fail alert\] Number one answer, Java! ...with 22 respondents naming Java their least favorite programming language. So again, Chuck and Robbie get to play, and this is round two. So we go now to Chuck. Two through six still out there - what programming languages do you think our listeners do not like very much?

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm going to pick PHP again.

**Jerod Santo:** So you picked it on the favorite, and now you're picking it on the least favorite.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I feel like it could have made both.

**Jerod Santo:** Kind of a shotgun approach, or what's the strategy here?

**Chuck Carpenter:** A little bit of that, yeah. I've only got three answers in my head, and I'm just gonna read them over and over.

**Jerod Santo:** They're the only languages that you know of. \[laughter\] Okay, let's see if PHP made it around this time; I guess because it wasn't on the last board, maybe that's some evidence that it might be here. Is it? \[win alert\] Yes, it is. Number two answer, with 18 people hatin' on PHP. But there's still many left. We go back to Robbie.

**Robbie Wagner:** I'm going to say -- so are Typescript and JavaScript different in the context of this? Well, I'm gonna say TypeScript. I think a lot of people don't like TypeScript.

**Jerod Santo:** show us TypeScript... \[fail alert\] Sorry, Robbie. Much to my chagrin, people don't dislike TypeScript as much as they should. \[laughter\] But no, they didn't mention that. Back to you, Chuck.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Okay... Again, my shotgun approach... I am going to say .NET.

**Jerod Santo:** Can you be more specific? The programming language itself.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Right, not for the framework, yeah... C\#.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, now you got it. Show me C\#. \[win alert\] Yes, bottom of the board, C\#. Six points. So you've gotten one and two and six. Three, four and five are left. You have one strike against you. Back to you, Rob.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Come on, Robbie.

**Robbie Wagner:** How about just normal C? Is that different?

**Jerod Santo:** Normalcy? Like, they don't like things being normal?

**Robbie Wagner:** No, I mean like --

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, puns encouraged. \[laughter\] You said normalcy. Like, they prefer it when things are frantic? Okay... Normal, plain, old C. Do people despise plain, old C? You bet they do. \[win alert\] Number four answer. Eight people do not like C. Alright, three and five are next. It's getting tougher... Chuck, what do you think?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Cold Fusion.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Cold Fusion? \[fail alert\] Most of our listeners might not know what Cold Fusion is...

**Adam Argyle:** ActionScript, yeah.

**Una Kravets:** That was my web development class in college, it was Cold Fusion.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you love it, or hate it, or think it was just okay?

**Una Kravets:** I'd put it on this list.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, fair enough. So we're down to our last guess before the steal. I'm starting to have some deja-vu, guys... Let's see what we can do here. Number three and five are both out there... Robbie, what do you think?

**Robbie Wagner:** I'm gonna continue with C and say C++.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us C++. \[win alert\] You got it. Number five, with seven people not liking to increment their normal C.

**Robbie Wagner:** Good. Now Chuck can fail us. \[laughter\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** Thanks.

**Jerod Santo:** Chuck, it's all on your shoulders, my friend. Number three answer is waiting for you to identify.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I am not happy about this... I think maybe it's a non kind of serious answer... Maybe your listeners like the irony. I'm going to pick JavaScript.

**Jerod Santo:** Could it possibly be that the least favorite programming language of 100 people that listen to a podcast about said programming language... \[laughter\] What kind of logic is this, Charles? Well, it's good logic, because it's the correct answer! \[win alert\]

**Robbie Wagner:** Nice...!

**Jerod Santo:** 11 of our listeners cannot stand JavaScript.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, it's a love/hate thing is what I was thinking. And I can empathize with that.

**Una Kravets:** That's a good answer, yeah.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, very nice.

**Jerod Santo:** It was a good answer. Just like that, you guys are back. I award you those points; that's 72 points for the Whatnots, and CSS Pod is sitting at 75. So after round two, it is absolutely anybody's game. We move now to round three.

This is back with Una and Chuck facing off. We'll let Chuck go first this time.

\[14:06\] We asked 100 of our listeners, "How big is your primary computer monitor?" And I will say that the answers were all over the board. So we've grouped by ranges. These are all ranges that match, but you don't have to match the range. Just name a size, and I'll tell you if it fits inside of that range. Alright, Chuck, you're up first. How big do you think people's monitors are, generally?

**Robbie Wagner:** 36 inches.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 36. \[fail alert\] Sorry, you've found the one range that actually has zero points. Somehow you managed to find it. So this goes to Una... Literally, that's like the only answer wasn't gonna match. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** I can say anything.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, pretty much anything is going to be on here, but he found a gap in the ranges. Go ahead.

**Una Kravets:** We'll see. I might also just not --

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna go with 32 inches. I think that's how big my monitor is.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 32. \[win alert\] Yes, the number two answer, between 31 to 35 inches. 13 people had exactly 34 inch monitors, and 23 people matched inside of that range. So you matched a range, which means you've taken the board, and now for the first time you and Adam will get to play a round. So that's the second answer. One, three, four and five are still out there. It is not 36... Adam, what do you think?

**Adam Argyle:** 24.

**Jerod Santo:** Do a lot of JS Party listeners have 24 inch monitors? \[win alert\] Yes, they do. Number three answer, which covers the ranges 20 to 24, of which 15 of the 20 had exactly 24 inch monitors. So you landed on a common one there. Alright, Una, back to you.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, I'm gonna go to laptop screen sizes now... So maybe 15 inches?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 15. \[win alert\] number four answer, covering ranges 13 to 19. Five of the 18 people had exactly 15 inch monitors. But yeah, that is your laptop range. 18 of our listeners, that's the number four spot, so we still haven't matched that number one spot yet... Or the last spot. So back to you, Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** 12.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us 12. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but that goes underneath the minimum size of 13. I guess we've moved past that age in our lives where we have 12 inch monitors. So back to you -- that's one strike. Back to Una.

**Una Kravets:** Good try though. That was solid. iPads, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Primary computer monitor, remember the specific question...

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna go with just deducing the information we have here, 25 to 30 inches.

**Jerod Santo:** 25 to 30 inches. Show us 25 to 30. \[win alert\] That is our number one answer. 18 people have 27 inch monitors - it's a very common size - and 26 Total people fit inside of that range. So you have 87 points match; that number five spot's still there. You have one strike, two guesses to land the number five. Adam?

**Adam Argyle:** They don't. They don't use an external monitor. None.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me none. \[fail alert\] Too clever. Too clever, my friend.

**Adam Argyle:** Dang it.

**Jerod Santo:** We're down to our very last guess now. It's starting to look --

**Adam Argyle:** Save us.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, wait, so 36 wasn't on here... I'm just talking out loud.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Please do.

**Una Kravets:** But that would theoretically be like the next category. Do people have, like, really big -- I don't even know how big they make them.

**Adam Argyle:** Some people do. Oh, we can't confer --

**Jerod Santo:** No, don't talk, Adam. She's talking out loud... But you have to talk privately, Adam.

**Una Kravets:** There's like the curved monitors, which could be double wide... So if 36 is not a category in here, let's go with maybe 40 inches. That's my guess.

**Jerod Santo:** 40 inches. So she's thinking no 36... You have to guess the upper range of that range. This is tough. Is she up to the task? We asked 100 JS Party listeners -- I'm stalling now for dramatic effect. How big is your primary computer monitor? Did more than five of them say 40 inches? \[win alert\] You got it. 40+ inches, seven people...

**Una Kravets:** \[18:14\] What?!

**Adam Argyle:** Go, Una, go Una, go!

**Jerod Santo:** ...three of which have 49 inch monitors. So congrats to you all three for doing that, I guess... And congrats to Una and Adam for clearing the board. A couple of noteworthy answers... One person said "I'm too lazy to measure it." It's like, alright, just leave it blank then. You don't have to write that. Another person said 24 inch horizontal, but 27 vertical. That person was not too lazy, apparently, to measure it. One person said "I'm totally blind. I don't use a monitor." So don't forget about our blind friends. And then one person just wrote "iMac." It's like, come on. That's not even a size. \[laughter\] So thanks for nothing to that particular listener... But at the end of round three, all 94 points now going to CSS Pod. Una with the final answer there awarded, and taking now - I wouldn't say a commanding lead, but a lead, is CSS Podcast, with 169 points. But watch out for those Whiskey Web and Whatnotters. They're still hanging in at 72, and we move now to round four.

Okay, this is our now famous inverted round. So in the inverted round, you want to match not the most popular answers, but the least popular answers, that were at least popular enough to have five. So the top of the board, one, is worth the least amount of points, and the bottom of the board, six, is worth the most amount of points. There is no face-off in this round. We're just going to switch back and forth between the teams, taking turn guessing.

The question that we asked our listeners, "What non-financial work benefit do you prize the most?" And we have the top six answers now on the board. We will take our challengers first. Let's go to Robbie. What do you think people said when we asked them "What non-financial work benefit do you prize the most?"

**Robbie Wagner:** Does health insurance count as financial, or no?

**Jerod Santo:** You'll have to ask our 100 JS Party listeners...

**Robbie Wagner:** Okay, let's say health insurance.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us health insurance. \[fail alert\] Sorry, that did not make the top six. We turn now to CSS Podcast. Let's go to Adam. What do you think?

**Adam Argyle:** I'm thinking funsies. \*bleep\* and giggles.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me funsies...

**Adam Argyle:** Survey says...

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\] I'm sorry.

**Una Kravets:** Jerod's face was like "Whaat?!"

**Jerod Santo:** Nobody thinks funsies is a work benefit. \[laughter\] It'd be cool though if that was listed on the perks.

**Chuck Carpenter:** On the employment contract, funsies, 10%.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. Alright, this is gonna be a fun round already, I can tell. Let's go now to Chuck. What do you think?

**Chuck Carpenter:** It can't be worse answers than those... \[laughter\] Free coffee.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us free coffee. \[fail alert\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** Whaat?!

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you laid the gauntlet, and then you managed to maybe match it.

**Una Kravets:** What obscure benefits are these?

**Jerod Santo:** Nobody wants free coffee. Una, your turn. Somebody please match the board.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna say free food.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's go back to the drawing board. Show us free food... \[fail alert\] Think bigger, think better, think smarter. Robbie, back to you.

**Robbie Wagner:** Um, flexibility to work remote?

\[21:35\]

**Jerod Santo:** *Jerod here in the editing room... I should point out that on a live show, I heard Robbie say "flexibility", but I did not hear him say "to work remote." That may seem like a small distinction right now, but this round is about to go off the rails, and it'll make a lot more sense to you with that little nugget in your pocket. Okay, back to the Feud.*

**Jerod Santo:** \[21:55\] Good answer. Good answer. Did people appreciate freedom and flexibility? \[win alert\] They sure do. That's the number two response, 18 people, but it is near the top of the board, and this is the inverted round, so you only get 10 points, because it's number two. We'll award those now, and we will go back to CSS Pod. I believe it's Adam's turn...

**Adam Argyle:** What is PTO?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us paid time off. \[win alert\] Now we're starting to hone in on what people appreciate. That is the number three answer. Some people said "Unlimited PTO", some said "Generous PTO", some said "Actually unlimited PTO, not that fake unlimited, where you pressure us not to take it..." 17 people answered in that category; it's the number three answer, so it's worth 15 points. I'll award those now, and we'll go back to Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Chuck, I believe it's your turn. We have one, four, five and six still able to be matched.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, new hardware.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. Show me new hardware. \[fail alert\] Not quite good enough. That one had a few answers, but not enough.

**Una Kravets:** That's what I was gonna say, so I'm glad you said it first...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you're trying to match unpopular, so I can't blame you. But nonetheless, Una.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, this is hard, because some of them have financial aspects to them.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. So it's up how do they interpret it.

**Una Kravets:** Right.

**Jerod Santo:** I thought insurance is a good answer, but it's also -- it's financial if you just break it down, right?

**Una Kravets:** Yeah. Oh, man... Yeah, a lot o them I'm thinking are financial, but what non-financial work benefit...? Benefit... Maybe the networking that you get at work, with co-workers... Maybe your co-workers that you like, I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good one. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** That's not on there is it?

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so maybe it's not so much the end goal, but the friends that we made along the way. Is that an important value that people benefit at work? \[win alert\] Yes, it is. And it's not that important, so it's number five, which means it's worth a lot of points. This covers friendships, team events, networking, hanging out, meeting people. So that covers that whole category. And it's worth 25 points, because only seven people answered that. We'll award those now, and go back over to the other side. Alright, Robbie, we have one, four and six. So far, we have freedom and flexibility of schedule, we have unlimited or generous PTO, and we have friends and team events all answered. What else could people value that are non-financial?

**Robbie Wagner:** What about work/life balance?

**Jerod Santo:** Could you be more specific? Or could you put it in different words?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Say new words...

**Robbie Wagner:** I don't know, if you were to say it in different words, what words would those be? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright... I would say that your burgeoning upon one, but I might have to strike it unless you can reword it quickly.

**Robbie Wagner:** Like, not having to work longer than nine to five, I guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, that one I'm going to put under freedom and flexibility, so I'm gonna go ahead and say wrong... \[fail alert\] But you may have dropped a little breadcrumb for Adam... Unfortunately it's your turn now; maybe you learned something from Robbie.

**Adam Argyle:** I do not know the synonyms for work/life balance... \[laughter\] That's the term I tend to use with all my friends as well. I'm gonna say "Skills and experience." So the acquired, like, on-the-job intelligence.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Skill acquisition. Alright, show us on-the-job intelligence. \[win alert\] Yeah, we'll give it to you.

**Una Kravets:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Not exact words up there, but learning, education... This included skills development. It's the number four answer; eight people said it, which means it's worth 20 whole points. We'll award those now, and you're building your lead, CSS Pod. We're back to Chuck, but that number six is still out there. It's worth 30, so there's plenty of points on the board if you can match that sixth spot. Chuck, what are you thinking?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Alright, I'm gonna try and follow the Reese's Pieces and I'm gonna say job satisfaction.

**Jerod Santo:** \[25:53\] Job satisfaction. I'm not going to ask you for a synonym; I'm gonna go ahead and say yes, that is one. \[win alert\] And this is the general category of challenge, impact made, and that kind of quality. I think that is job satisfaction, is how much is my impact. Only five people appreciate job satisfaction, which means it's worth a whopping 30 points... So we'll award those now. But strangely, the most popular, the number one, and somewhat overwhelmingly so still hasn't been matched by anybody. So I'm wondering, what's going on with that? Una, back to you.

**Una Kravets:** My initial thought was sort of like working on interesting problems, which I think is the challenge and impact.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, totally.

**Una Kravets:** But I also think a piece of it is building your portfolio, which I think is slightly different. So maybe my answer is going to be something around building your portfolio, or like open source work... Because a lot of people get to do open source work, and highlight the work that they do in their communities... So that's gonna be my guess, is open source, or --

**Jerod Santo:** I definitely see that as a benefit. Unfortunately, it's not the number one benefit on the board. \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Is it number six? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it would be number seven or below. It didn't quite make the board, so not the point... But we're only here working for five points, so I'm making you guys work really hard for not very many points... It's what I do, it's what I love. Robbie the Wagner, what are you thinking? Did you think of a synonym yet?

**Robbie Wagner:** Oh, okay, so it's so that then...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, there hasn't been a synonym that matched quite yet.

**Robbie Wagner:** No, I mean... \[laughter\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** No is not an answer.

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I had other answers, but now that you've said that that's what it is...

**Jerod Santo:** No, go ahead. Go ahead and guess whatever you like.

**Robbie Wagner:** No, no, I know it's not --

**Jerod Santo:** I've got nowhere to be. I can just keep hitting this --

**Una Kravets:** Go ahead and guess the wrong thing... \[laughter\]

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, no problem. Who needs five points...? Let's say... All of this is like flexibility though I feel like, but not a lot of meetings, so you can get work done, I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say that's flexibility, so I'd say guess something else. I ixnayed you last time, so I'll let you guess another one this time. You're being around this bush... We do have a timer though. It's in my head, and it's counting down furiously.

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I don't have anything. I'll pass.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** I think I know what it is.

**Jerod Santo:** Una thinks she knows it. Is it your turn, Una, or is it Adam's?

**Una Kravets:** No, I think it's Adam's.

**Jerod Santo:** It's too fast for me. Okay, Adam, do you think you know it?

**Adam Argyle:** I don't think I know it, but I have a swag at it, which also -- did you flinch when I said the word "swag"?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Argyle:** No. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Well played, well played...

**Adam Argyle:** I tried to do the horse trick.

**Jerod Santo:** You're trying to read me?

**Adam Argyle:** If it's foot kicks, I'm like "Oh, good. That must be the right answer."

**Jerod Santo:** I have been told that I have a tell.

**Adam Argyle:** I am watching you touch your chin.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Adam Argyle:** You're touching your chin. You've got no hair there, but you're reaching for it. So that mean the answer is close?

**Jerod Santo:** He's thinking, he's thinking...

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah. I'm gonna say -- well, as much as I want to say like beer, like a kegerator, I'm actually going to say security. Security, job security. It's like an intangible feeling and benefit that you get from having a good job.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show me job security. \[fail\] Unfortunately, job security is not any sort of synonym for work/life balance.

**Chuck Carpenter:** For work/life balance. There are no other words for work/life balance.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, since we're struggling, I'll drop a little more... It's not a synonym for a work/life balance, but it's just in that general area of work/life balance. Back to Chuck.

**Chuck Carpenter:** That's what I thought security was. I was like "Security's that vibe, ish..."

**Una Kravets:** It's a good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good guess. I'll just say, there's a gap that's gonna be very obvious when you guys hear it. I don't want to say more, because I'll give Chuck too much to chew on.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Grid gap or flex gap? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know CSS, so I can't answer that... Just kidding.

**Robbie Wagner:** It's not a programming language...

**Jerod Santo:** It's not JavaScript.

**Una Kravets:** According to the survey...

**Jerod Santo:** Or is it JavaScript? That'd be a an ironic answer.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Survey says... Chuck is dumb. What is like work/life balance, but not those words...?

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** And not freedom or flexibility. I don't know. I'm just gonna say respect.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good answer, actually. \[fail alert\] It's a wrong answer, but it's a good answer. I like that one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm not getting there.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, can't get none... Una, have you been thinking about it over there? I thought you said you thought you had it.

**Una Kravets:** I think I know it. I think I'm picking up what you're putting down.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, let's hear it.

**Una Kravets:** \[30:09\] My guess is that it is parental leave. It's like work/life balance, but -- it's in that realm, but it's not work/life balance.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... That's a really tough one. That's actually -- it was categorized previously under like generous paid PTO, like paid time off.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So great thought. Definitely, people answered it. I grouped it into PTO. So I'll let you go again.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, no, that was my thought.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that's your thought?

**Una Kravets:** I don't have any more.

**Jerod Santo:** We can go back to Robbie. Okay, this is getting very --

**Chuck Carpenter:** Robbie, you can do it.

**Jerod Santo:** The plot is thickening. We'll just do that... \[fail alert\] Sorry, I have a contractual obligation to make that noise. Robbie, since you've been beating around the bush, I'll give you a little bit of a hint. This is actually something that's controversial, and in our common dialogue people talk about it. They write blog posts... It's important today in our society. That makes it harder...

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** For me it's obvious, because I know the answer.

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah... \[laughs\]

**Una Kravets:** Parental leave?

**Jerod Santo:** Parental leave? \[laughs\] Yeah, that was a great answer, just grouped in already. I'll provide another hint in the next round, because now I'm starting to play favorites here... Rooting for the underdogs, as is my penchant...

**Una Kravets:** This is hard.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, I'll say it right now; here is the other clue, okay? Freedom and flexibility is about flexibility of schedule. It's not about any other kind of freedom or flexibility. It's just about like being able to make your own hours, and stuff. So if you're thinking that that's covered, that part's covered, but there's another thing that's not covered... Which all of our audience is screaming into their podcasting apps right now. "Why won't you just say --"

**Robbie Wagner:** Well, I said this before, but like working from home?

**Jerod Santo:** Working from home? Remote work? Could it be the number one answer? \[win alert\] It is! Work from home/remote.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Good job, Robbie.

**Una Kravets:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Well done, Robbie. I'm glad that you got it at the end of the day, because you were closest to it when I didn't give it to you before... So I will award you those five points, which we spent more than five minutes acquiring...

**Chuck Carpenter:** We were so close.

**Jerod Santo:** Unfortunately, after that round you're still not in the lead. Whiskey Web and Whatnot has 117 points. CSS Pod has 229 points. That's round four. But have no fear, guys, because rounds five and six are both double points. So plenty of time to come back, and we now move to round five.

Double point round. Name a SaaS - that's software-as-a-service, not some sort of attitude disposition... Name a software-as-a-service that you can't imagine living without. Five answers on the board. We will have a face-off, and I believe it's Adam and Robbie this round. Is that correct? Yes, it is. Alright, Adam and Robbie, step right up. You shall be facing off. Let's start with Adam. Adam, name of SaaS that you can't imagine living without. Better yet, name one that our audience can't imagine living without.

**Adam Argyle:** GitHub.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us GitHub. Number one answer, GitHub.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** But only 12 respondents, so this was a very dispersed round. It's worth 24 points, and it takes the board. So we now have a CSS Podcast playing this round. We go to Una. Name a SaaS you can't imagine living without.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna say Vercel, for hosting and other things.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Vercel. \[fail alert\] Sorry, Vercel is not on the board. Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Netlify.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Netlify. \[fail alert\] Wow...

**Una Kravets:** That was my next guess, so I think we're on the same page.

**Jerod Santo:** Two strikeouts in a row... Back to Una. You have a chance of losing it here already. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** Don't tell me that...

**Jerod Santo:** I hate to break it to you, but that's just where you stand.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna say Analytics, maybe Google Analytics...

**Jerod Santo:** \[33:53\] Show us Google Analytics. \[win alert\] That one is bundled into all kinds of Google things: Google Drive, Google Pay, Google Analytics, Google Maps. These are all software as a service that seven of our listeners can't live without, so it's worth 14 points. That's the number four slot. Two, three and five are still out there, one strike left. Adam, what do you think?

**Adam Argyle:** I'm gonna say logging services. So you've got your Sentrys, your LogRockets, your... Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us logging services. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, that is not on the board. So a chance to come back and a chance to steal for Whiskey Web and Whatnot.

**Chuck Carpenter:** And we can confer on this one, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, you two can discuss. You get one guest.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, because it's top of mind and talked a lot about recently, do we say ChatGPT?

**Robbie Wagner:** I guess that counts...

**Jerod Santo:** I'll stop you right there. This survey went out prior to the ChatGPT craze. So it will not be on there, because it wasn't -- we did this survey late fall.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, okay.

**Una Kravets:** That's a great guess though.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it is.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I would have thought, like, yeah, why not what I'm seeing a bunch...?

**Robbie Wagner:** What if clarify - does that count for GitHub Copilot as well?

**Jerod Santo:** GitHub Copilot was definitely out for a long time before that, so I would allow that answer.

**Robbie Wagner:** That could be a good one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I would say either that, or like -- there's got to be hosting of some kind on here, like Cloudflare, or...

**Robbie Wagner:** Can you just say AWS in that sense then?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Maybe... You have the software interface for deploying and all that, so I would think...

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I think that's a good answer.

**Chuck Carpenter:** AWS.

**Jerod Santo:** AWS, are you going with it?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, let's do that.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us AWS.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Survey says...

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\] Ah... I think what happened this round is I think our listeners answered more personally, and we were all thinking more developery, because the services they actually talked about are more like lifestyle, personal things. So no steal. There's only 38 points so far. We'll award those to CSS Pod. And now I'll show you the answers. We had number five was Stripe, so that one is definitely a developer service. Number three was Gmail or email providing. So again, that's more of a personal thing than a developer thing. And then number two, of course, leave it up to JS Party listeners - "None. I don't have any service I can't live without it."

**Una Kravets:** There it is. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** If you asked me, one rejection of the premise per show. It's kind of a requirement around here. So quick round, not very many matches. Still within reach. CSS Pod has 267, Whatnot with 117, but we have our final round coming up, and it's worth double points. Let's get to it.

Speaking of GitHub Copilot... So I will preface this with the contextualization this survey was provided for our previous Frontend Feud game, which was last fall. So GitHub Copilot was very much a thing, ChatGPT came out in November-ish... So the current AI frenzy was not quite happening yet, but we did ask our audience "In a word, how does GitHub Copilot make you feel?" This is about their feels. And we will go with a face-off between Una and Chuck. Let's have Chuck go first.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I'm trying to contextualize, because -- well, it makes me feel creepy.

**Jerod Santo:** GitHub Copilot makes Chuck feel creepy. Does it make our audience feel creepy? \[laughter\] \[win alert\] Yes, it does. Number four answer.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Wow. I was doing that for the lols.

**Jerod Santo:** Close enough... They said icky. So I kind of put that in with creepy. So that means they felt exploited, robbed or icky, all in that category of "Yeah, it's creepy, it's exploitative etc." So that's number four. This is a face-off, so we're back to Una. You can steal the board and play it if you can name one, two or three on the list of words that GitHub Copilot made our audience feel.

**Una Kravets:** This is a very divisive thing. You can go either way here. I will say, as a representative of the CSS Podcast, Copilot is very bad at CSS. Very bad at it. I think it's just the general quality of the web. So I'm gonna say frustrated and annoyed by it. And I think a lot of people probably feel that way, too. If they know their craft and they're getting results, that's unexpected. So I'm gonna go with frustrated/annoyed. It seems like the same thing to me.

**Jerod Santo:** \[38:14\] Yeah. Show me annoyed. \[win alert\] Yes, they are annoyed. However, it's the number six answer. They're also tired. So this, I think, was more about annoyance of hearing about it, talking about it etc. But I gave it to you because you said annoyed and the word is annoying. Hence the long pause for me to think about "Should she get it or not?" So you get it. However, Chuck's answer was number four, and this was answered number six. So he actually wins the face-off and they play this round. Guys, this is your Big Shot. Here we go. Alright, Robbie, what do you think?

**Robbie Wagner:** I'm gonna say productive.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us productive. \[win alert\] Number one answer, worth a whopping 44 points. People feel empowered and productive because of GitHub Copilot. Very good answer. Chuck, it's looking good. What do you think?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, it sounds like people weren't so pessimistic as I had considered... Informed?

**Jerod Santo:** Show me informed. \[fail alert\] It did not make the board. Back to you, Robbie.

**Chuck Carpenter:** How about dumb?

**Jerod Santo:** Can you say more? Like, they feel dumb, or do they think it's -- I mean, in other words, do they feel dumb, or do they think it's dumb?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Like, it makes them feel dumb, because it's like "Oh, I didn't know how to do that that way."

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Thanks for the clarification. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but no.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, so the other way is the answer you want, Chuck...

**Jerod Santo:** No comment...

**Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, that wasn't helpful. So instead of feeling dumb, Robbie's insinuating that they would feel like validated, or smart. Maybe I'll just pick smart. They feel smart.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm gonna group that under productive.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Then pick something else is what you mean. They feel... Nothing.

**Jerod Santo:** Always rejecting the premise. I appreciate that effort. Unfortunately, they feel something... \[fail alert\] So no, they do not feel nothing. A couple of people did say "Don't care" or "Nothing", but not enough. So chance to steal. Go ahead and confer. Three things to match. One is gone, that's empowered and productive. Four is gone. That's exploited, robbed or icky, creepy. And six is gone. That's tired or annoyed. But two, three and five are left. Adam and Una, a chance to steal and a chance to seal your three-time championship.

**Una Kravets:** Dang.

**Adam Argyle:** No pressure. Alright, what you got? I have three possibilities.

**Una Kravets:** I mean, just going off of what Jerod said, there's --

**Jerod Santo:** You can't go off what I said...

**Una Kravets:** The potential answer of people think that it is dumb; it sort of makes them feel dumb. So I don't know, that seems to be on the board...

**Adam Argyle:** That's kind of annoyed. You know, you're annoyed, because you're like "This is supposed to be smart, and it's giving me dumb stuff."

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, I kind of feel like it is a part of that. But yeah, what are your ideas?

**Adam Argyle:** I think -- so here's my silly one, is that it makes them feel like a pilot. Get it? \[laughter\] Wow, that really... That really flopped.

**Jerod Santo:** There's your feedback right there...

**Adam Argyle:** You're not so funny, apparently... No, the one I think is decent is scared or anxious. It's making them worried about their job.

**Una Kravets:** On the other hand, they could be excited about thinking about higher-level concepts; not having to do all the smaller steps to get there. I don't know...

**Adam Argyle:** My last one is -- well, I guess this one's kind of supposed to be funny too, but it makes them feel like a tool... So I feel like a tool, because this thing is just reading all my stuff and generating more, and it's just like "Oh, I'm just a cog in its big machine."

**Una Kravets:** I like your idea about anxious or worried.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, let's just scared or anxious. I think so, too.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, let's go with that.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. We asked 100 JS Party listeners, in a word, how does GitHub Copilot make you feel? Three answers on the board, chance to a steal, and to secure once again a frontend feud championship. Does it make our audience feel worried, anxious or concerned? \[win alert\] Yes, it does.

**Una Kravets:** Wooh! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That is the number three answer. Some people just said it makes them feel poor, like they're gonna be poor... \[laughter\] Because it's gonna make them that way.

**Adam Argyle:** \[42:12\] Unemployed.

**Jerod Santo:** Which is 102 points stolen and awarded to CSS Podcast. Let's find out what the other things people feel. So we had number one was empowered and productive; number two - this was the one where I was trying to get you guys to circle the wagon on... They're unimpressed, or they said "Meh." So that's kind of the "It's dumb." Not "I'm dumb", but "It's dumb." So that would have definitely matched. Anxious, concerned, poor, jobless was another thing people said... Exploited, robbed, or icky - that's number four. We got that one. Number five was "Curious about it", they're interested in it, kind of excited, but don't know much about it... And number six, we had as "Tired or annoyed with the entire conversation." So for those people, I apologize we're still talking about it... But what are you gonna do?

**Una Kravets:** We'll have to have ChatGPT in the next one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. ChatGPT may or may not have written these questions for you guys... \[laughter\] So after six crazy rounds and a great game, our contenders, Whiskey Web and Whatnot, you guys finished off with 117 Points. Very honorable. Thanks for playing. But our winners, for the third consecutive game in a row - I'm never gonna get rid of these two. It's Adam and Una from CSS Podcast. Congratulations!

**Adam Argyle:** I feel so good about my victory.

**Una Kravets:** Do you feel empowered and productive? Unimpressed and meh? Anxious and poor? \[laughter\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** Is this your highest points total? I just want to know how bad --

**Jerod Santo:** I would have to go back and check. It's definitely up there. 369 points is quite a few.

**Adam Argyle:** I think y'all scored higher than one of the other teams...

**Jerod Santo:** Humblebrag?

**Una Kravets:** We'll go with that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** I guess we got something...

**Jerod Santo:** We will now do our post-game Super Bowl interview. Adam. 30-time championship, unprecedented, no one's ever done this... You managed to win Frontend Feud for the third time. Tell me, right now in this moment, how do you feel?

**Adam Argyle:** I feel like a turkey. I feel like I look like a turkey, I've acted like turkey--you know three bowling wins, what is a turkey? You don't know what a turkey is?

**Jerod Santo:** You switched games on me. I was thinking football, you're going bowling... Fair enough.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm turkey. I feel like a turkey. I'm gonna go eat a turkey, I'm gonna pet a turkey, I'm going to do all the turkey things that I can. Is there a turkey whiskey? I'm gonna drink some turkey whiskey.

**Chuck Carpenter:** It's called Wild Turkey.

**Adam Argyle:** There you go. I'm down. I wanna get a bottle and celebrate.

**Una Kravets:** There you go.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm glad you connect it back into the conversation with the wild turkey. I was about to dock you about 200 points. \[laughter\]

**Chuck Carpenter:** Is there a turkey thing?

**Jerod Santo:** But I won't do that. Actually, you still would have won. Dang it. Okay, Una. You really came through in the clutch. I mean, you had a couple of big steals, you really carried Adam... He was pretty pathetic the entire game. I think I saw him tearing up at one point... What do you say when your teammates ask you how this day went, and how you performed?

**Una Kravets:** \[45:07\] Well, as a single tear slowly trickles down my cheek, I want to thank my teammates, I want to thank my mom, I want to thank my family, I think my dog... No, it's all good fun. Thanks for having us.

**Jerod Santo:** It is all good fun. I always have a blast with this game. And I can tell you, as the person who knows all the answers, it's very frustrating to sit on the side and watch you guys grasp at them. But I empathize. I'm not tired and annoyed. I'm curious and interested, you know? And I'm glad that you guys managed to finally realize how important working from home is for the average software developer; talk about a knowledge gap... Chuck and Robbie, thanks for playing. Anything you'd like to say? Whiskey Web and Whatnot, do you want to tell folks what your podcast is about, what you guys are doing, etc?

**Chuck Carpenter:** Well, first of all, I just want to comment that the ref made some questionable calls there... I don't know, I think it could have been a little bit of a closer game, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I will now revoke your opportunity to plug... \[laughter\] Terrible timing, Chuck.

**Robbie Wagner:** Unplug. Unplug Chuck.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Just kidding. Go ahead.

**Robbie Wagner:** We'll just kick Chuck out. \[laughter\]. No, dude. Were you gonna continue with stuff to plug, or do you want me to say things, Chuck?

**Chuck Carpenter:** No, you do it.

**Jerod Santo:** He actually thought I cut him off.

**Chuck Carpenter:** No, I was cutting myself off, and just letting Robbie do it.

**Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, Whiskey Web and Whatnot is, as the name implies, about Whiskey Web and general whatnot. So it's a fun time, it's a little bit of a different format. We drink some whiskey, get to know people on a more personal level... Of course, talk some tech hen it makes sense. You can check it out at whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm, and find all of our links to everything else from there.

**Jerod Santo:** Very cool. But the final word goes to our champs, Adam and Una. Anything you'd like to say? Open mic to the JavaScript world and web development friends. What do you wanna say? Anything you want.

**Una Kravets:** My open mic is if you haven't checked out CSS in a while, a lot has changed in the last three years. There's a lot of really powerful new capabilities. We are having a new season launching a little bit later this year, maybe soon... But that's my call to action, is if you haven't explored what's new in CSS, it's probably gonna blow your mind. So take some time to do that.

**Jerod Santo:** Very good. Adam. Anything to add or subtract?

**Adam Argyle:** I want to know how many tentaclees y'all would give Wild Turkey, Whiskey Web and Whatnot.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Well, it really depends on which one.

**Adam Argyle:** I mean tentacles. I just wanted to say tentaclees. Oh, is there multiple-colored labels? Then the label that's the cheapest.

**Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, okay. So the bourbon 101. I actually think it's really decent for like about a $25 whiskey... So for me, I like them a little spicy. I'd give it seven tentacles.

**Adam Argyle:** Seven tentacles on a Wild Turkey. Alright.

**Chuck Carpenter:** I like it. I come back to it.

**Adam Argyle:** That's pretty good.

**Jerod Santo:** Seven out of eight, I assume. Wow. There you go, Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Oh yeah, I'm supposed to keep talking after that. Oh, my bad. I like y'all show. It's really good. The Whatnot's good, the whiskey is good, your guests are good... Y'all do a good job posting that, so I'm happy to meet you in-person here. I just -- everybody, go own your content. Make an RSS feed if you don't subscribe to RSS. Go get it. Go find people. It's really nice, direct to your people. No overlords, no gardens, just straight up content. Email newsletters are good, too. I don't know, we're in a good point in time where you can own it and deliver it right to people's hands. It's pretty cool, so... Check that out.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, on behalf of our awesome contending podcasts, I'm Jerod Santo, this is JS Party. This has been Frontend Feud. Thanks so much for hanging out with us, but that's all for this time. We'll be back with another Frontend Feud at some point, but we need to find somebody who can beat the CSS Podcast. That is all for now, but we'll see you again on the next one.
