**Jerod Santo:**

What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, September 2nd, 2024. But deliverd to you on Tuesday. We're _off-by-one_ again as the powers that be in the US of A *insist* on Monday holidays. If I'm elected president, I will tackle the issues that _really_ affect the lives of all Americans:

1) Cancelling Daylight Savings once & for all
2) Moving all federal holidays to Friday (as God intended)

Ok enough dreaming, let's get into the news.

[Cursor wants to write all the world's code]()

The team behind [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) (an AI code editor) made a splash last week, announcing their $60 million Series A funding. People are excited about what the editor can do today (better than GitHub Copilot, some say) and what it might be able to do in the future:

> Already, in Cursor, hours of hunting for the right primitives are being replaced by instant answers. Mechanical refactors are being reduced to single "tabs." Terse directives are getting expanded into working source. And thousand-line changes are rippling to life in seconds. Going forward, we hope Cursor will let you orchestrate intelligent background workers, view and modify systems in pseudocode, instantly scan your creations for any trace of a bug, and much more.

One BIG differentiating factor for Cursor is that it's an entire editor vs something that you use with existing ones. This could be brilliant, because it lets the team control the entire environment. Or it could be foolish, because most devs love our editor and switching to something else is like changing our identity...

[Rug pulls aren't cool, but are they worth it?](https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2024/08/26/software-licensing-changes-and-their-impact-on-financial-outcomes/)

RedMonk's Rachel Stephens decided to "examine if changing an underlying open source project’s license from an OSI-approved license to a proprietary license has a measurable impact on financial outcomes for the commercial entity backing the project."

That's not an easy question to answer, but that didn't stop her. She looked at MongoDB, Elastic, HashiCorp & Confluent's revenue, market cap & net income over time. Click through for the charts. For the conclusion:

> While in our sample we see revenue grow post-license change, we don’t see a notable change in the rate of growth. We also see very mixed results in company valuation, and there does not seem to be a clear link between moving from an open source to proprietary license and increasing the company’s value.

[Caleb Porzio made $1 million on GitHub Sponsors](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-cracked-1-million-on-GitHub-sponsors-heres-my-playbook)

I remember [interviewing Caleb](https://changelog.fm/381) when he'd just crossed $100k four years ago. (Link in the newsletter) Time flies! Here's his breakdown of where the milly came from:

- 5k: Goodness of their hearts "buy me coffee" sponsors
- 5k: Sold a bunch of stickers once lol
- 20k: Early access to a side project called "Sushi"
- 25k: Hourly consulting
- 20k: Alpine conference (I made $0 from this though)
- 200k: Companies paying me to put their logos on my websites and such
- 725k: Livewire premium screencasts

Lesson learned: when it comes to open source, there's always money in ~~the banana stand~~ educational resources. Reminder: Caleb makes this stuff look easy. IT IS NOT EASY. Steph Curry makes 30-foot jumpers look easy, too...

[Elasticsearch is open source, again](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-is-open source-again)

Elastic founder/CTO, Shay Banon:

> Elasticsearch and Kibana can be called Open Source again. It is hard to express how happy this statement makes me. Literally jumping up and down with excitement here. All of us at Elastic are. Open source is in my DNA. It is in Elastic DNA. Being able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again is pure joy.

They chose the OSI-approved AGPL as an additional license to the current offerings (ELv2 & SSPL). I honestly did not see this one coming, but I'm happy about it. Read the post for more details (plus some unexplained Kendrik Lamar references strewn throughout) including a portion where Shay pre-answers the trolls who might say, “Changing the license was a mistake, and Elastic now backtracks from it”

> We removed a lot of market confusion when we changed our license 3 years ago. And because of our actions, a lot has changed. It’s an entirely different landscape now. We aren’t living in the past. We want to build a better future for our users. It’s because we took action then, that we are in a position to take action now.

[The art of finishing](https://www.bytedrum.com/posts/art-of-finishing/)

Tomas Stropus:

> It’s a quiet Saturday afternoon. I’ve carved out a few precious hours for coding, armed with a steaming cup of coffee and the familiar urge to dive into a project. As I settle into my chair and open my terminal, I’m confronted with a challenge that’s become all too familiar: deciding which of my many unfinished projects to tackle.

Sounds familiar? I bet it does. Here's Tomas' list of strategies that help him finish, in brief:

1. ✅ Define “Done” from the Start
2. 🚀 Embrace MVP
3. ⏳ Time-Box My Projects
4. 🧩 Practice Finishing Small Things
5. 💡 Separate Ideation from Implementation
6. 🎉 Celebrate Completions
7. 👥 Embrace Accountability

I've long said that starting something new is easy. People do it all the time. But _finishing_! *That's* the accomplishment. This is why I believe [arbitrary deadlines are actually awesome](https://changelog.com/posts/arbitrary-deadlines-are-actually-awesome).

Ship, by any means necessary. Because good artists borrow and great artists steal, but [real artists ship](https://www.folklore.org/Real_Artists_Ship.html).
