What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, April 8th 2024

Mateus Freira wrote a very nice comment on Spotify about our [undercover generalist](https://changelog.com/friends/37) episode, but since approximately zero people read those, I figured why not give it a boost?

> Amazing episode, this is the kind of content that makes me open Spotify twice a week and come here. To hear from real developers out there making real stuff. Keep them coming Changelog.

Thanks, Mateus! Ok, let's get into the news.

[HashiCorp strikes back](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opentofuorg_opentofu-project-was-recently-made-aware-activity-7182147077496344576-jsDQ/)

On April 3rd, Matt Asay published a piece for InfoWorld titled [OpenTofu may be showing us the wrong way to fork](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714980/opentofu-may-be-showing-us-the-wrong-way-to-fork.html). In it, he says:

> that OpenTofu may have illegally taken HashiCorpâ€™s code to keep pace. At least, itâ€™s hard to avoid that conclusion, perusing OpenTofuâ€™s GitHub repositories and comparing them to HashiCorpâ€™s.

The code in question is a new feature in Terraform 1.7 that also landed in OpenTofu as the fork maintainers work to maintain parity. Asay claimed:

> OpenTofu took this BUSL-licensed HashiCorp code, removed the headers, and tried to instead relicense it under the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).

As a beleaguered boxer might say, "Them's is fighting words." So, it naturally prompted many armchair software copyright lawyers to analyze the code in question and determine whether or not it was actually copy pasta. Smart people have landed on either side of this issue. [Dan Lorenc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danlorenc/) from ChainGuard says:

> I did my own audit and the samples bear no resemblance despite implementing similar functionality, which is honestly hard to do in Go where there are so few ways to do things. I can't possibly see any validity to this claim.

Meanwhile, [Joe Duffy](https://twitter.com/funcOfJoe/status/1776479584613171288) from Pulumi concluded:

> There are three major kinds of taint, from worst to least worse
>
> 1. Copied the code directly
> 2. Read the source and was influenced by it
> 3. Copied the functionality
>
> Iâ€™ve seen this game enough to know that if the file, function, and variable names, plus non-zero number of statements, match, youâ€™ve probably got at least level 2 (if not level 1). And thatâ€™s a problem. Thatâ€™s pretty clearly true of at least remove_statement.go.

Asay later issued [this statement](https://twitter.com/mjasay/status/1776635226124632423) about his article:

> I regret how strongly i expressed myself (force of habit ðŸ˜¬),but grateful for those who expressed support against mob dog piling. Two are execs my post put under fire. They didn't agree w/ my conclusions but responded w/ kindness. They're the kind of OSS community I want to join

A few days later, OpenTofu posted this on their LinkedIn page:

> OpenTofu Project was recently made aware of a letter by HashiCorpâ€™s lawyers, alleging that OpenTofu was not respecting the terms of its BSL license governing its Terraform codebase. OpenTofu vehemently disagrees with any suggestion that it misappropriated, mis-sourced, or otherwise misused HashiCorpâ€™s BSL code. Indeed, it seems that HashiCorp may be conflating code that it had previously been open sourced under the MPL and more recently developed code it published under the BSL. OpenTofuâ€™s maintainers have investigated this matter, and intends to issue a written response providing a more detailed explanation of its position in the coming days.

I'm excited to read OpenTofu's written response, but I have a feeling it's only going to get uglier from here. If I'm running the OpenTofu project, I'd be seriously considering a change in strategy from "feature parity" to "differentiation" from now on...

[Polar is a creator platform for developers](https://polar.sh)

Polar is like Patreon, but tailored to software creators. Their tagline is, "get paid coding on your passion" and, I have to say, that's a compelling proposition...

They're "just getting started", but the current suite enables maintainers to offer: exclusive posts & newsletters, access to private GitHub repos, Discord invites & "Sponsorship 2.0" (logos on your READMEs). There's a few things that are interesting to me about this:

1. Zero fixed costs (5% rev share + Stripe fees)
2. Issue funding and reward splits
3. Mitchell Hashimoto joined on as an advisor

Watch this space. You know I will.

In the linked video, Synadia's Jeremy Saenz addresses the current state of overwhelm when building micro-service architectures, and how a technology like NATS.io can help solve many of the current requirements for microservices within a single piece of infrastructure. Here's a sample.

[Releasing Common Corpus](https://huggingface.co/blog/Pclanglais/common-corpus)

Pierre-Carl Langlais, announcing the release of [Common Corpus](https://huggingface.co/collections/PleIAs/common-corpus-65d46e3ea3980fdcd66a5613) on Hugging Face (March 20th, 2024)

> Contrary to what most large AI companies claim, the release of Common Corpus aims to show it is possible to train Large Language Model on fully open and reproducible corpus, without using copyright content. This is only an initial part of what we have collected so far, in part due to the lengthy process of copyright duration verification. In the following weeks and months, weâ€™ll continue to publish many additional datasets also coming from other open sources, such as open data or open science.

More info about this massive dataset:

- Common Corpus is the largest public domain dataset released for training LLMs.
- Common Corpus includes 500 billion words from a wide diversity of cultural heritage initiatives.
- Common Corpus is multilingual and the largest corpus to date in English, French, Dutch, Spanish, German and Italian.
- Common Corpus shows it is possible to train fully open LLMs on sources without copyright concerns.

[Loki is an open source tool for fact verification](https://github.com/Libr-AI/OpenFactVerification)

This Python-based tool is designed to automate the process of verifying factuality. Its list of components helps explain how it does what it does:

- **Decomposer**: Breaks down extensive texts into digestible, independent claims, setting the stage for detailed analysis.
- **Checkworthy**: Assesses each claim's potential significance, filtering out vague or ambiguous statements to focus on those that truly matter.
- **Query Generator**: Transforms check-worthy claims into precise queries, ready to navigate the vast expanse of the internet in search of truth.
- **Evidence Crawler**: Ventures into the digital realm, retrieving relevant evidence that forms the foundation of informed verification.
- **ClaimVerify**: Examines the gathered evidence, determining the veracity of each claim to uphold the integrity of information.

Put all that together and what you have is a python script where you can run `python factcheck.py --modal string --input "Loki is the God of Mischief"` and Loki will go out there and verify that for you.
