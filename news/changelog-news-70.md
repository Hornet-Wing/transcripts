**Jerod Santo:**

What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, November 13th 2023.

Most of the buzz of late is in response to OpenAI's [DevDay keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk), where they announced GPT-4 Turbo and no-code custom AI agents they're calling "GPTs." It's still early, but OpenAI is looking a lot like the iPhone of this new platform opportunity, app store and all. If true, this begs the question: what might be the Android of "AI"?

Oh, and GitHub says they've been "re-founded" on Copilot. But I think that's silly, so I'm not really going to talk about it any further... Ok, let's get into the news.

sshx lets you share your terminal with anyone by link, on a multiplayer infinite canvas. It has real-time collaboration, with remote cursors and chat. It's also fast and end-to-end encrypted, with a lightweight server written in Rust. (So you know it's cool)

All you have to do is install the open source CLI by curling sshx.io/get and piping the output to your shell, or build it from source if that's more your thing. This gives you the sshx command, which, when executed kicks off a live, encrypted session. Send the link to whomever you want to join in and they open it in a web browser.

Resizing, moving windows, zoom and pan all work, you can see other people's cursors in real time, and more. Check it out at sshx.io

Herbert Lui has a blog on creativity, marketing, and the human condition where he recently published a brief post called 'three things about your competitors' Thing 1 is: "If a tattoo artist does a good job the first time you get a tattoo, youâ€™ll be interested in getting more tattoos. Theyâ€™ve just created an opportunity for other tattoo artists."

Thing 2 is "If somebody reads a book about creativity, theyâ€™re probably actually more likely to read another book about the topicâ€”not less."

And thing 3 summarizes things 1 and 2: "While competitive energy can be helpful, itâ€™s certainly not the onlyâ€”or the most accurateâ€”way to see the world. There are enough problems to go around, and a problem often requires more than one solution."

That's the entire post, so no need to go read it. But if you're picking up what Herbert's putting down with this one, check out his other writings. He even has a book titled "Creative Doing".

There are umpteen ways to deal with JSON in your terminal, and fx by Anton Medvedev looks like a great one. It's written in Go, so efficient performance and universal binaries mean easy installation. It's interactive, which means you can visualize the JSON tree structure, folding and unfolding areas that interest you. Plus, it supports streaming JSON data, which helps process large datasets. It has JSON comments support, mouse support, and clipboard integration.

Danny Castonguay's team at bld.ai are attending COP28 in Dubai alongside 70k other people, so he wrote up some advice that resonated with me, having attended KubeCon last week. Danny says:

"Large conferences can be chaotic and draining. The fear of missing out is real. I recommend steering clear of the main stage(s), unless thereâ€™s a superstar speaker youâ€™re eager to meet. Instead, prioritize scheduling in-depth, one-on-one interactions with a few individuals youâ€™re looking to build lasting connections with."

He says a good rule of thumb is to add one to three (at most) new connections per day. This would've been good advice for me _before_ I left for KubeCon. Oh well, next time I guess.

Jeremy Pinto's experimental RAGTheDocs project is working toward a reality I'm very much waiting for: it'i's an open source library that enables a one-click deploy of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on any readthedocs documentation using HuggingFace spaces!

RAG, for the uninitiated, is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLMâ€™s internal representation of information. In the case of RAGTheDocs, that external source of knowledge is your project's docs!

How it works: RAGtheDocs automatically scrapes and embeds documentation from any website generated by ReadTheDocs/Sphinx using OpenAI embeddings. It also ships with a gradio UI for users to interact with and lets you customize the experience as well.

It's early days and still an experiment, but there's a lot of potential here to have custom-tuned LLMs who have automatically read the docs, so we don't have to.
