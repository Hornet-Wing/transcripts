**Jerod Santo:**

What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, October 20th, 2025.

In light of the major, ongoing AWS [outage](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status?ts=20251020)... I hope you're not having a terrible start to your work week. But if [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com) is anywhere near accurate, those hopes are all but dashed.

Every time AWS goes down, I'm reminded of the quip: "Turns out 'the cloud' is just some building in Virginia."

Ok, let's get into this week's news.

[The science behind developer flow states](https://leadership.garden/developer-flow/)

In an excellent piece designed to help engineering leaders and developers understand flow states and how to reclaim them, Csaba Okrona lays out exactly what Flow is:

> Flow, as defined in the research, is “a psychological state of complete immersion and engagement in an activity.” For developers, it's that magical zone where code seems to write itself, complex problems unravel naturally, and hours pass in what feels like minutes.

Then he enumerates the three major blockers to flow:

1. Insufficient cognitive challenge
2. Situational barriers
3. Internal factors

And then shows you how to *engineer* your way back to Flow. Most of us can't get this done entirely on our own. In that case, forward this to your boss!

[The day my smart vacuum turned against me](https://codetiger.github.io/blog/the-day-my-smart-vacuum-turned-against-me/)

Let's do this one "teaser trailer"  style:

> Deep within the robot’s startup scripts, I discovered the smoking gun.
> 
> Inside the /etc/init.d/ directory, one script had been modified to prevent the main application from launching. This wasn’t a glitch; it was an intentional command...
> 
> Someone—or something—had remotely issued a kill command.

Are you sufficiently *teased*?!

[Ruby core team takes on RubyGems, Bundler](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2025/10/17/rubygems-repository-transition/)

Ruby creator, Matz, shares some much-needed news for the Ruby community after the recent debacle (that we discussed in-depth on last Friday's show):

> RubyGems and Bundler are essential official clients for rubygems.org and the Ruby ecosystem, bundled with the Ruby language for many years and functioning as part of the standard library.
>
> Despite this crucial role, RubyGems and Bundler have historically been developed outside the Ruby organization on GitHub, unlike other major components of the Ruby ecosystem.
>
> To provide the community with long-term stability and continuity, the Ruby core team, led by Matz, has decided to assume stewardship of these projects from Ruby Central. We will continue their development in close collaboration with Ruby Central and the broader community.

[Zed for Windows when? Windows now](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-for-windows-is-here)

The wait is over. Zed for Windows is here!

For a long time, Windows devs have been asking the same question: Windows when? Well, now. The Zed team just dropped a native Windows build, built from the ground up with the same speed, multiplayer editing, and buttery-smooth experience that Mac and Linux users have been bragging about.

Why’d they do it? Because great tools shouldn’t care what OS you’re on. Zed’s mission has always been about fast, collaborative coding — and now, that magic extends to the world’s largest community of developers.

So whether you’re pair-programming with your Mac-using teammate or just want an editor that feels instant on Windows, Zed’s ready.

[Claude Skills could be bigger than MCP](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/)

Simon Willison is pretty excited about Anthropic's recent announcement of [Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) – a simple Markdown system that teaches Claude how to do new things.

> Claude Code is, with hindsight, poorly named. It’s not purely a coding tool: it’s a tool for general computer automation. Anything you can achieve by typing commands into a computer is something that can now be automated by Claude Code. It’s best described as a general agent. Skills make this a whole lot more obvious and explicit.

Simon goes on to explain how Skills compare to MCP, why he likes them better, and how Skill sharing might make this year's MCP rush "pedestrian by comparison." In the end, it's all about *simplicity*.

> Skills are Markdown with a tiny bit of YAML metadata and some optional scripts in whatever you can make executable in the environment. They feel a lot closer to the spirit of LLMs—throw in some text and let the model figure it out.

[Knowledge creates technical debt](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/knowledge-creates-technical-debt/)

Luke Plant looks at everyone's favorite *software-solutions-as-things-you-sometimes-acquire-on-credit* metaphor from a different perspective, which may serve to cast it in a more positive light than usual:

> The “pile of technical debt” is essentially a pile of **knowledge** – everything we now think is bad about the code represents what we’ve learned about how to do software better. The gap between what it is and what it should be is the gap between what we used to know and what we now know.

Thinking of tech debt in this manner feels more like an opportunity gained by learning stuff vs a liability you have to pay off. And who doesn't love a good opportunity?!

> You can refuse to take that opportunity if you want, but it’s a tragic waste of your hard-earned knowledge – a waste of the investment you previously made in learning – and eventually you’ll be losing money, and losing out to competitors who will be making the most of their knowledge.
