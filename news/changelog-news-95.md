**Jerod Santo:**

What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, May 20th, 2024.

We have a short episode for you this week as I have to catch a flight this afternoon to Seattle for [Microsoft Build](https://build.microsoft.com). If you're going to be there, let me know! Adam and I would love to connect with as many folks as possible while we're there 🙏

Ok, let's get into the news.

[Kyle explains "Legacy Software" to the aliens](https://taylor.town/legacy)

Every so often, Taylor Troesh publishes something so _stinkin' good_ I'm actually mad about it. I don't even know why I'm mad, but at least *one* of the reasons is that I struggle to pick a pull quote. Ok here's my best shot:

> Why not use the old languages? Ha! Dude, nobody uses those languages anymore! They don't have any of the new libraries.
>
> No, we don't port over the new libraries because it would feel too "clunky."
>
> Of course, we try to make the languages less clunky! It's called "ergonomics." But whenever we add ergonomics to a language, it becomes clunkier.
>
> No, we can't rewrite the legacy software in a new language because the problem is usually too dangerous or complicated.
>
> I guess they got lucky? Nobody today would dare tackle those same problems in the same languages.

Ok sorry I can't limit myself to just one shot. Here's a chaser:

> Sorry, no more questions. I'm two minutes late for standup. Humanity is deprecating TypeScript next year, so we're migrating our proxy server to HypeScript, but we just found out it's incompatible with our orchestrator, so we have to switch cloud providers. Please don't call this number again.

If I had more time today, I'd read this entire post for our Changelog++ people. It's that good slash funny slash poignant. But I gotta catch a flight, so let's plow forward.

[Why designers aren’t understood](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/designers-business-ux-language/)

Smashing Magazine's Vitaly Friedman addresses why so many designers feel misunderstood and under appreciated in business contexts:

> Corporate language is filled with metaphors of fighting. Companies “conquer” the market, they “capture” mindshare, they “target” customers, they “destroy” the competition, they want to attract more “eye-balls, get users “hooked, and increase “life-time value.
>
> Designers, on the other hand, don’t speak in such metaphors. We speak of how to “reduce” friction, “improve” consistency, “empower” users, “enable and help” users, “meet” their expectations, “bridge the gap”, “develop empathy”, understand “user needs, design an “inclusive” experience.

This is two very different ways to communicate. In response, Vitaly shares how he approaches language in business meetings, not by adopting the language of the business world, but by **telling a story** (in eight parts):

> Next time you walk in a meeting, **pay attention to your words**. Translate UX terms in a language that other departments understand. It might not take long until you’ll see support coming from everywhere — just because everyone can now clearly see how your work helps them do their work better.

[Oracle dumps Terraform for OpenTofu](https://www.thestack.technology/oracle-dumps-terraform-for-opentofu/)

> Oracle has swapped Terraform for the open source fork OpenTofu under the hood of its Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Cloud Manager. It is now telling customers they “must” make the shift to its new OpenTofu-based version of the migration/provisioning tool by June 30, 2024.

The reason for the switch is unsurprising, but notable nonetheless: "due to forthcoming Terraform licensing changes." This is a big vote of confidence for the fork. Will Oracle's move be a one-off or the first big domino to fall in an OpenTofu rally?

[Hackers discover how to reprogram NES Tetris from within the game](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/hackers-discover-how-to-reprogram-nes-tetris-from-within-the-game/)

It is bonkers that people have the time (and wherewithal) to discover this stuff:

> the player has to hold down "up" on the third controller and right, left, and down on the fourth controller (that latter combination requires some controller fiddling to allow for simultaneous left and right directional input). Doing so sends the jump code to an area of RAM that holds the names and scores for the game's high score listing, giving an even larger surface of RAM that can be manipulated directly by the player.
