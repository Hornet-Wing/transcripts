What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, February 24th, 2025.

My fellow Severance fans must know that Apple TV has [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnDYB28bL8) eight hours of music for us to refine to. They call the ODESZA set, "perfect for your innieâ€™s workday." So good. So gold.

Ok, let's get into the news.

[AI killed the tech interview. Now what?](https://kanenarraway.com/posts/ai-killed-the-tech-interview-now-what/)

Kane Narraway thinks through the radical change AI tools have brought to the (already-fraught) technical interview process. He says [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is pretty much broken, comp sci fundamentals and coding interviews are also out, but architectural interviews still work, at least for now:

> From talking to people who have run these, itâ€™s evident that someone is using AI. They often stop with long pauses, do not quite explain things succinctly, and do not understand the questions well enough to prompt the correct answer. As AI gets better (and faster), this will likely follow the same fate as the rest but I would give it some years yet.

Kane suggests five options of how we can adapt, some which are better than others:

1. Stop remote tech interviews
2. Require some Pearson Vue-type spyware
3. Bury our heads in the sand
4. Change our interviews to allow AI
5. Hybrid Approach

Something's gotta give. In the meantime, Kane thinks we'll see more people passing their interviews then being let go during their probation period. That sucks for everybody involved. What are you doing/seeing in this space? Hit reply, I'd love to hear about it.

[An app to lock your apps until you touch grass](https://touchgrass.now)

Rhys Kentish wanted to change the habit of reaching for his phone in the morning and doomscrolling away an hour, so he built an app to help him do just that. It's built in [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and uses the Screen Time APIs provided by Apple plus Google Vision to recognize grass or not. Cool idea, but tough to manage for anybody living in deserts or tundras. Should he add an in-app purchase to change touch "grass" to touch "snow", "dirt", or "sand"? ðŸ˜†

[Play with Retool's guided tour](https://login.retool.com/guided-tour)

Now you can play with Retool, no account requiredâ€”and you get a guided tour.

Retool recently launched a guided tour so you can see how easy it is to build internal tools based on data in their managed PostgreSQL database service (called Retool Database). The tour walks you through building an orders UI and connecting that interface to a real database with real data, complete with realtime search. You'll get to see how simple they've made it to build tooling without any frontenders neededâ€”allowing them focus on customer facing things.

If you haven't yet, now's a good time to play with [Retool's guided tour](https://login.retool.com/guided-tour) to see how simple it is to build apps on top of their managed PostgreSQL database or your own database.

[Microsoftâ€™s Majorana 1 chip](https://news.microsoft.com/azure-quantum/)

Microsoft tried really hard to make a big splash last week announcing their quantum computing efforts.

> Quantum computers promise to transform science and societyâ€”but only after they achieve the scale that once seemed distant and elusive, and their reliability is ensured by quantum error correction. Today, weâ€™re announcing rapid advancements on the path to useful quantum computing

Are you excited yet? No?! Well, then just read this copy!

> Built with a breakthrough class of materials called a topoconductor, Majorana 1 marks a transformative leap toward practical quantum computing.

Their hype-inducing efforts kinda worked? People are excited about the progress despite the fact that quantum computing isn't useful in any real way yet. But hopefully someday! Even if not, you have to admit the Majorana 1 *looks* really cool...

[On washing machines & estimations](https://www.cosive.com/blog/my-washing-machine-refreshed-my-thinking-on-software-effort-estimation)

Chris Horsley recently had a saga installing a new washing machine that he thought would take 10 minutes. It ended up taking him four whole hours. Sound like anything we know? In this excellent, analogical post, Chris tells the tale of the *six* yaks he had to shave during his install process and what he learned from the whole ordeal.

> What we fail to factor in is that while 90% of the project will be the same, there's going to be one critical difference between the last 5 projects and this project that seemed trivial at the time of estimation but will throw off our whole schedule.

[Discover the IndieWeb, one blog post at a time](https://indieblog.page)

Andreas Gohr built something cool! It's like [StumbleUpon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon) (before capitalism got it) but for the IndieWeb. Why did Andreas build it?

> I love reading text written by real people. Texts that don't want to sell something. But how can you discover texts you can't search for because you don't know they exist?
>
> That's where this page comes in. Click a button, be surprised and maybe discover your new favorite thing.

You can [suggest](https://indieblog.page/suggest) your own or a friend's personal site as long as it has an RSS feed. Sweet!

That's the news for now, but also scan the companion newsletter for all the links and more, including: Google served Go backdoor to devs for 3+ years, Wireshark for Docker containers, and A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate

Scroll back in your feed for some awesome pods: last week we spoke with David Crawshaw all about his experinece programming with LLMs and on Friday Adam and I discussed the dev opinions we have and have NOT changed our mind on over the years.

Coming up this week: Anurag Goel from Render on Wednesday and Kaizen 18 with Gerhard Lazu on Friday.

Have a great week! Leave us a 5-star review if you dig our work, and I'll talk to you again real soon.
