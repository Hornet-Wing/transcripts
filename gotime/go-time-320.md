**Mat Ryer:** Hello, and welcome to Go Time. I'm Mat Ryer. Today we're at GopherCon Europe, Berlin. And yes, we're playing Gophers Say.

So playing today - I'm team zero. We have Cameron, Chioma and Ron. And yes, and team one is made up of Johnny Boursiquot, Travis and Paula. So I'll explain the rules very quickly. And you each get - -you can have your own mic there, and you'll share the mic between you. Okay, so we have two teams, and they've gotta guess the answers that you gave in the survey. So the audience here in Berlin answered a survey, they answered a load of questions; you've got to guess what those gophers say. Remember, it's not about right or wrong, this is about what these good people think. And that's also very interesting sometimes.

At the start of each round two team members will go head to see who gets control of the board. From there, you will then have a chance to go through the team and answer all the questions. But beware, you have only three lives. If you get three answers wrong, the other team gets a chance to steal. And in that chance, they only have to get one right answer and they steal all the points. So this is a game you don't -- you don't confer on the game unless you're stealing. So you don't talk to each other. It's all about you, unless you're stealing. If you get a question right, you might hear this sound. \[win alert\] That's generally considered good news. But if you get an answer wrong, you're gonna hear this noise. \[fail alert\] And that's horrible, isn't it, when that happens?

**Ron Evans:** Can we have just like a normal buzzer when we lose, instead of that one?

**Mat Ryer:** No. But it's a fine question. To be honest, I'd quite like that feature in real life, when someone says something that's wrong. You just hit \[fail alert\]. That'd be useful.

**Ron Evans:** Does that happen often to you, Mat?

**Mat Ryer:** No, I've never known it happen to me. Right... Let's get into this first question. The question is, "What is the first Go function that comes to your mind?" We're going to start with Cameron. Have a guess. What's the first Go function that comes to your mind? What did our gophers say?

**Cameron Balahan:** Main.

**Mat Ryer:** Main. Gopher say? \[win alert\] And it's the top answer. So that gets you 24 points. There's no chance for you to steal, unfortunately... So you keep control of the board. And we go over now - Chioma? What do you reckon? What was the first Go function that comes to people's mind?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** I would have said main as well.

**Mat Ryer:** Do you wanna just go for that one as well?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Oh, a different one.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. What's the first Go function that comes to your mind?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** What's the first Go function that comes to mind... A get method, or something?

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. You say a get method. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] No, nobody said that. Unfortunately, you lose a life. But don't worry, you've got two other lives. Ron, what do you think?

**Ron Evans:** Go.

**Mat Ryer:** You think go function is the first one that comes to their minds.

**Ron Evans:** You say go, I say go.

**Mat Ryer:** You say go. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] Oh, no one --

**Ron Evans:** Am I the only person using go in Go? Don't lie...

**Mat Ryer:** Don't worry, you've still got another life. Cameron, it's back over to you.

**Cameron Balahan:** Init.

**Mat Ryer:** Innit. Are you just being cool, bruv? \[laughter\]

**Cameron Balahan:** No, no.

**Mat Ryer:** No, you're not. Okay, sorry. I thought you were being cool.

**Cameron Balahan:** I don't know how to be cool.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:09:56.25\] Okay. Init. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. Also not. And unfortunately, you lose three lives, innit? It's crazy, innit? \[unintelligible 00:10:03.26\] Get mad at these. That means though team one, you get a chance to steal. You can confer on this, into the microphone, please. It's a podcast. Into the microphone, Johnny. It's a podcast. You're on the podcast, you should...

**Paula Babbicola:** Everyone's favorite debugger, print.

**Mat Ryer:** You can keep talking. Imagine this is fun.

**Travis Cline:** I don't know... New? I mean...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** He wants us to confer on the mic.

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, please.

**Travis Cline:** Prntln?

**Paula Babbicola:** Yeah, prntln is better than print.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, we'll go with that. Prntln.

**Mat Ryer:** Prntln. Okay. Fmt or log?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Fmt.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, fmt prntln, you say. To steal the board. Gophers say? \[win alert\] Second place. Fmt prntln. And that gets you 13 points. Okay, so you steal these the points, they all go to you. You get 38 points there. Let's see what else was there. We had main at the top there with 24, then fmt prntln, 13 people said that. In position three fmt prntf. Are we just going to now list the fmt package? Number four, main, and number five, panic. It would have got you five points.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Don't panic...!

**Mat Ryer:** Don't panic.

**Ron Evans:** He said "Don't panic", I said \[unintelligible 00:11:28.00\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay, good. So relax, everyone, as we go into round two. Okay, the question for round two - we asked our gophers to name their favorite coding website. What on Earth did they say? We are going to start with Travis. We're gonna go to you first.

**Travis Cline:** Hey, not Johnny?

**Mat Ryer:** No.

**Travis Cline:** Okay. Oof. Oof. I don't think this is going to be a number one position, but just to be in line with my talk, I'm gonna go with ChatGPT.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, ChatGPT. You say ChatGPT. Gophers say... \[win alert\] In the last place there, ChatGPT. It has five points. Chioma, you now have to beat that answer in order to get control of the board. So you just need an answer that's better than that.

**Chioma Onyekpere:** I would say Go package website, the documentation.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's an interesting thought. The Go package website. Gophers say? \[win alert\] Yes, it's on there, and it's the top answer.

**Travis Cline:** We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

**Mat Ryer:** So you now get a chance to complete their guess. Ron, you're up next. What do you think?

**Ron Evans:** GitHub.

**Mat Ryer:** GitHub? What's that?

**Ron Evans:** It's a place where they keep my code hostage.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Are you sure it's not the other way around?

**Ron Evans:** I'm not sure, no.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. You say GitHub. Gophers say? \[win alert\] Of course it's on there... And it's in position three, which gets you 12 points. Cameron, it's your turn, innit?

**Cameron Balahan:** Yeah... Google.com.

**Mat Ryer:** Google.com. Okay, you say Google.com. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. No one googles anymore, because there's ChatGPT. Surprise, that one. Okay, you lose a life, but don't worry... Chioma, what do you think? Name your favorite coding website. Just look at them. What do you reckon?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Copilot?

**Mat Ryer:** Copilot?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Yeah. Let's see. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] No. No one said Copilot. Okay, Ron, you've lost two lives.

**Ron Evans:** No pressure.

**Mat Ryer:** No pressure.

**Ron Evans:** Well, looking out at you wonderful humans in the audience, and looking that ChatGPT is in last place, I'm gonna go with the old-school answer, Stack Exchange.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:13:56.02\] Okay. Stack Exchange... We'll accept any of those - StackOverflow, Stack Exchange. Gophers say... \[win alert\] Yeah, baby! Second place there, which gets you 13 points. Okay, Cameron, you've just gotta get this last one, and you hoover up all the lovely points.

**Cameron Balahan:** What's left...?

**Mat Ryer:** What's left...?

**Cameron Balahan:** Yahoo.com... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** If you're gonna do banter, can you do it into the microphone? Oh, you did. Good.

**Ron Evans:** Any trash talk, into the microphone, please.

**Mat Ryer:** Ron, you were just shouting out loud, instead of using the mic.

**Ron Evans:** Any trash talk, through the microphone, please.

**Mat Ryer:** He says it again... \[laughs\] Alright, Cameron...

**Cameron Balahan:** Alright. I'm not that confident in this, but I'm gonna go with gobyexample.com.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, gobyexample.com. It's nice one. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. It's not there. So team one, you have a chance to steal. Please confer loudly into the microphone. I really don't want to have to tell you again. You will kick yourself.

**Cameron Balahan:** The Go playground? Something like that. I use it occasionally.

**Mat Ryer:** Go.dev covers all the playground and all those ones?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's a hard one.

**Cameron Balahan:** Reddit, maybe? Something like that.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, Reddit. That's interesting. Okay, I'm gonna have to press for an answer.

**Travis Cline:** There's no downside to us guessing, right?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** How about if you squint, maybe Gopher Slack. You could access it online, right?

**Mat Ryer:** It does have a web interface, but... Is that what people would think?

**Ron Evans:** If you're looking into the audience for the answers, that's the right place.

**Travis Cline:** Yeah. Can we ask the audience?

**Mat Ryer:** No, unfortunately you don't have that \[unintelligible 00:15:43.14\] lifeline.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Can we get a hint? It starts with the letter...

**Mat Ryer:** W. It starts with www. \[laughter\] Okay, I need to press you now... Pick a website. There's loads of them.

**Travis Cline:** You can go for Slack, I think.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, I would just go with Gopher Slack.

**Mat Ryer:** Gopher Slack. I think that is an honorable answer. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, it wasn't. So what was it? Shout out. Any ideas? YouTube. Gopher say...? Yes, that would have got you six points.

**Travis Cline:** We probably should have gotten that one, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Some other interesting answers... Two people said Hacker News. Two people said none. Just no website helps. One person said Twitter, whatever that is... And a couple of people just X-ed it out. So there we go.

**Ron Evans:** That's Twitter, too.

**Mat Ryer:** That's Twitter, too. Yeah. Okay, let's have a look at the scores. Team one, you have 38 points. But team zero just got all those points from all the board, and they are leading with 49 points.

**Travis Cline:** We got this. We got this.

**Mat Ryer:** It's time for round three. We asked gophers "What is your beverage of choice while coding?" And Ron, we're going to take an answer from you first, to try and get control of the board.

**Ron Evans:** I'm gonna go with the first and obvious choice, which is coffee.

**Mat Ryer:** The delicious alternative to brushing your teeth, coffee. Gophers say... \[win alert\] Of course, the top answer. 35 points.

**Ron Evans:** I'm just a very typical developer.

**Mat Ryer:** Apparently so. Cameron, can you answer some more questions here?

**Cameron Balahan:** Well, I figure we're in Europe, and they maybe drink a little more espresso...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Cameron Balahan:** I'll go with that. Yeah, it probably does get bundled into the old coffee -- just because it's made of coffee.

**Cameron Balahan:** Alright, well, let me take it back then. So you know the answers... Let's go with Coke.

**Mat Ryer:** Coke. Coca Cola.

**Cameron Balahan:** Yeah. The drink.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I've done some lines of code, I'll tell you that...

**Cameron Balahan:** \[00:18:06.05\] \[laughs\]

**Ron Evans:** ChatGPT \[unintelligible 00:18:05.01\] come up with an awesome joke like that. ChatGPT could not make that kind of joke.

**Mat Ryer:** No, because it's got ethics built in. \[laughter\] Okay. Coke. Gophers say? \[win alert\] It's actually soda; or pop, we would accept it. That's in third place, and it gets you seven points. Coffee got you 35 points though, which is pretty good. Okay, what do we think, Chioma? What other drink do people drink when they're coding?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Well, everyone drinks water, so I'll go for water.

**Mat Ryer:** That's a good idea. You say water. Gophers say... \[win alert\] At number two there, 28 points. So to hoover up all of these points and take the whole board, Ron, you just have to get this last one.

**Ron Evans:** Well, there comes a point in the programmers day... I call it the golden hour. It's the hour when you switch from coffee to beer.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, thank goodness. I didn't know where that was going. Okay, you say beer. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. You lose a life. But it's okay, you've got two other lives. Cameron.

**Cameron Balahan:** For now. I'm gonna go with tea.

**Mat Ryer:** Tea. A little ripple of applause for tea. Some tea fans in here. But if you liked tea so much, you wouldn't have thrown it in \[unintelligible 00:19:29.14\] harbor in Boston, would you? Which - I think that's how they invented ice tea. Isn't it? They're like "Actually, this is pretty good." Okay, tea. You say tea. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. You lose another life. Okay, Chioma, back to you. You nailed it last time with water, plain water; it's up there. What else?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I'm assuming they love beer, and --

**Mat Ryer:** What do you drink when you code?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** I drink water when I code, but I already said that. I'm looking for hints. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, what could it be?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Are we considering energy drinks soda?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't think we would consider that as soda, no.

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Because energy drink then.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's fair enough. You say energy drink. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, and I'm afraid that's your last life. Over to the other team now, team one. You've got a chance to steal.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Question. Would beer be sort of considered alcohol in general, or is that a different category?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, when Ron said it and the big -- in microphones, everyone. Say that again.

**Ron Evans:** Beer is just a watered-down alcohol, so no.

**Mat Ryer:** What did I make him say that I into a mic...? When Ron said beer last time, he got a great big X, didn't he? Remember?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** So don't say that one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Got it.

**Mat Ryer:** There may be a clue on the board. Is that conferring going on, or are you just silently thinking, you lot?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We're looking for the hint. You said it was on the board.

**Travis Cline:** I mean, that's a can of beer I have there, so it can't be that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** My name is Johnny, and there's Johnny Walker \[unintelligible 00:21:16.29\]

**Mat Ryer:** Oh...! I don't know if I'm helping saying that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No, no, no, no. Go in your corner.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, what do we drink? Coffee scored 35 points. Plain water scored 28 points. Soda/pop, seven points. What else could they be drinking?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Does \[unintelligible 00:21:39.24\] category, since we're in Berlin?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, well, do you class that as soda?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** I mean, the drink in bottles, yes. Yes. The other one no. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** What are you saying, Johnny?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Carbonated water.

**Travis Cline:** That's not soda? That's not water? I mean...

**Mat Ryer:** It's not soda, is it? It's not plain water, is it? \[unintelligible 00:22:03.16\] take all the bubbles out?

**Cameron Balahan:** \[00:22:07.26\] Could be. How many Germans did we have? Can I get the hands?

**Mat Ryer:** We don't have that data. \[laughter\] We don't say "Are you German?" before we ask people questions.

**Travis Cline:** Okay, seltzer water. Final answer.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, this is it. Tension. And honestly, on the podcast they'll be playing tension music by this point, probably... You say seltzer water. Gophers say... \[win alert\] Sparkling water! That was the last answer, and it gets you five points... The clue, of course, being plain water. And that means you steal all those points.

**Ron Evans:** No beer or alcoholic drinks... So this explains a lot about code quality.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Some other interesting answers... Somebody put "Coffee as strong as Chuck Norris", and then someone put a grande iced double vanilla frapuccino with cream on top. It's soy milk, of course. I think they just thought that was a \[unintelligible 00:23:05.01\] Right. Now it's time for round four. And we're giving it a little twist here... It's time for the Unpopular Opinions round.

**Jingle**: \[00:23:15.27\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, so that means what we're looking for now is the most unpopular answers. So it still need to have got on the board, still needs to have been five people saying it... But now we're looking for the unpopular ones. And the question is, what is the first go keyword that comes to your mind? So what is the first Go key word that comes to your mind? We're looking for unpopular ones, and I think we're going to start with team one. We're gonna go for Johnny. Johnny, what's your guess?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** So if I understand this correctly, what is the keyword that is least desirable?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, in a way... It's complicated, isn't it? Yeah. It's like a Christopher Nolan round, this one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I will go with goto.

**Mat Ryer:** Johnny says goto. Gophers say... \[fail alert\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, come on.

**Mat Ryer:** Remember, it has to \[unintelligible 00:24:31.28\] No. It didn't even get onto the board.

**Ron Evans:** How many people knew you could do that even in Go? Raise your hands... Who has actually used it, keep your hand up.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Somebody said they used it. We need to talk. We need to talk.

**Mat Ryer:** If fewer than five people said it, it's not gonna feature on the board. So we are looking -- it has to be a bit popular. Okay. Cameron, to get control of the board, you just need one answer.

**Cameron Balahan:** We can all confer, can't we?

**Mat Ryer:** No, we're just gonna bounce \[unintelligible 00:25:01.24\]

**Cameron Balahan:** Oh, that's too bad.

**Mat Ryer:** There's no control.

**Cameron Balahan:** Defer.

**Mat Ryer:** Defer. Does that mean you're gonna give me the answer at the end? Okay, Cameron, you said defer. Gophers say... \[win alert\] On there, in point three. Eight people said that, which gives you 15 points. Okay. Now, Travis. It's your guess.

**Travis Cline:** Fallthrough. That's like up there with goto, come on.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Travis --

**Chioma Onyekpere:** It needs to appear somewhere on the board.

**Mat Ryer:** Travis says fallthrough. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, it's not there. Chioma, what's the first Go keyword that comes to their minds? Have a look at them. Do they have good minds? What are you thinking?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** The wait keyword...

**Mat Ryer:** The wait keyword, okay. You say wait. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, I'm afraid nobody said that. Right. Over now to Paula, team one.

**Paula Babbicola:** Switch.

**Mat Ryer:** Switch. You say switch, Paula, but what do our gophers say? \[fail alert\] No.

**Paula Babbicola:** \[00:26:11.25\] Come on, switch.

**Ron Evans:** I am going to go with the same answer for the most popular, which is go. No one ever got fired for using go, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Ron, you say go. Gophers say... \[win alert\] It is the top answer!

**Ron Evans:** I had the number one most unpopular answer.

**Mat Ryer:** 28 people said it, but this means you only get five points. But it's actually the most popular answer.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mat. Mat. Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Right here, behind you. Yeah. Mat, you've been a bad boy...

**Mat Ryer:** I thought it was God talking to me. That's what I think God would sound like. Is it just me?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I'm your daddy.

**Mat Ryer:** That's not God anymore... It's turned into a weird Terminator now... \[unintelligible 00:26:54.06\] I'm your daddy!"

**Johnny Boursiquot:** "Get to the choppa..." Okay. Well, so you lied to us. You told us those were the least desirable keywords. We've been guessing them the whole time.

**Mat Ryer:** Look at the points though. So the top answer being go, 28 people said it - it only gets you five points. So you score more points for defer, even though only eight people said it. That's how it's unpopular.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Alright...

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, we can do the song again, mate, if it'll cheer you up. Although I noticed you weren't singing. And you definitely know it. Okay. Ron, it's your turn, I think.

**Ron Evans:** \[unintelligible 00:27:31.24\] I mean, I'll go again to try to get more points, no problem. If you're gonna let me cheat, Mat... I mean, I'm happy to cheat for you if you want me to.

**Mat Ryer:** Don't make it funny, because then the mistake will stay in the edit. Okay, Johnny, it's your turn next to have a guess.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** If.

**Mat Ryer:** If. What is the first Go keyword that comes to your mind? Johnny Boursiquot says if. Gophers say... \[win alert\]. And it's the bottom answer, with five points, which gets you 30 points. Five people said that. Nice work. Johnny, still want to complain about the format, or are you good now?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, this is great.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Cameron, what do you think?

**Cameron Balahan:** Struct.

**Mat Ryer:** Struct. What's the first Go keyword that comes to your mind. Cameron says struct. Gophers say... \[win alert\] Six people said it, which earns you 25 points. Very good stuff. Travis, can you get these two? Well, just one of them... You can't guess both unless they're the same. They're not.

**Travis Cline:** Four.

**Mat Ryer:** The number, or the --

**Travis Cline:** Yes, the number four.

**Mat Ryer:** The number four. Okay, Travis says the number four. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, it's not on there, and neither is for. Good guess though. Alright, who's go is it now?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** I will say range.

**Mat Ryer:** Range?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Yes.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. \[fail alert\] No, I'm afraid it's not on there. That was a good guess though. Paula?

**Paula Babbicola:** Func.

**Mat Ryer:** Pardon?

**Paula Babbicola:** Func.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Func. Fair enough. Paula says func. Gophers say? \[win alert\] \[unintelligible 00:29:25.23\] answer there. 16 people said it, which gets you 10 points. Right, we're just looking for this final answer now. Ron, can you do it?

**Ron Evans:** Break.

**Mat Ryer:** Ron says break. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. Break's not there. Back around to Johnny. What are you thinking, Johnny? Tell us what you're thinking, in your voice, into the microphone. Are you just not thinking anything?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Nil.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:29:57.12\] Nil. Okay, John says nil. gophers say? \[fail alert\] \[unintelligible 00:30:00.14\] Cameron.

**Ron Evans:** Cameron, use your data knowledge of the internals of the Go team. It's alright, they did not say we could not do that.

**Mat Ryer:** True.

**Cameron Balahan:** Yeah... I had something and I knew it was it, and I forgot it. Oh, \[unintelligible 00:30:14.20\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Just so we're clear, we're talking about actual keywords of the language.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, actually, we aren't necessarily, because it's basically whatever people said. So they don't have to answer with keywords at all.

**Ron Evans:** Do you people even know Go?

**Cameron Balahan:** I was really thinking this, I forgot it, and then someone in the audience said it, so I remembered it. It's interface.

**Mat Ryer:** Interface. Okay. Cameron says interface. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] Oh, I'm afraid not. Travis, you can do this.

**Travis Cline:** Okay. It's between two, I think.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it is between defer and struct. \[laughter\]

**Travis Cline:** Right between defer and struct, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Travis Cline:** Um, return.

**Mat Ryer:** Return. Honorable guess, I think. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No. It doesn't return anything.

**Ron Evans:** There's no return.

**Mat Ryer:** No return. Okay.

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Var?

**Mat Ryer:** Var. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] Right, let's get into some rapid rounds now. Paula.

**Paula Babbicola:** The problem is I have been doing TypeScript the last few weeks...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, that's not our fault... \[laughter\]

**Paula Babbicola:** So I'm struggling a bit. \[unintelligible 00:31:22.04\] I guess. I hope. Um, type?

**Mat Ryer:** Type? What, because of TypeScript? That is absolutely mad. And also, gophers say... \[win alert\] Seven points. Seven people said it, which gets you 20 points. Wow. Excellent. That was the unpopular round. That was easy, wasn't it? \[laughter\]

So let's just have a quick look at the scores. Team zero's at 94, but team one has really pulled ahead, with 173. But don't worry, these are double points. We're going to double your points now, and all you have to do is guess what people said when we asked them "Software development makes me..." What did they say? What does software development make them? And we're going to Paula.

**Paula Babbicola:** Scream. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Scream. Okay, software development makes Paula scream. Is it like in a good way, or bad way?

**Paula Babbicola:** \[unintelligible 00:32:26.28\]

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:32:28.07\] Sorry, I'll just have a quick reread of the Code of Conduct. You said scream. Gophers say? \[win alert\] Yeah, sad or annoyed. 14 people said it, and we're going to double those points for you, so you got 28 points. You win control of the board... So Johnny, it's your go.

**Ron Evans:** I think we're going down.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see. You might be able to steal.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I'm an optimistic person, so I'm gonna say "happy."

**Mat Ryer:** Happy. Oh, that's nice. Software development makes Johnny scream, but happy. Gophers say... \[win alert\] Travis, what does software development make you do?

**Travis Cline:** That's pretty much full gamut already. I mean...

**Ron Evans:** Yeah, thanks for pointing that out, man....

**Travis Cline:** Those are the only four I ever feel, so...

**Mat Ryer:** Happy, fulfilled, sad or annoyed. You're a simple man.

**Travis Cline:** Oh, very, very. That's actually a little much for me even, so... Wealthy. \[laughter\] Well, \[unintelligible 00:33:27.19\]

**Mat Ryer:** Software development makes Travis wealthy. Gophers say? \[win alert\]

**Travis Cline:** Yay...! \[unintelligible 00:33:38.17\]

**Mat Ryer:** Excellent stuff. Okay, we're gonna go straight into the next round after I tell you that Team Zero has 94 points, but team one has really pulled out now ahead, with 255 points. Amazing stuff.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Does the other team know the objective of this game is to win it, or...? I'm just talking a little trash, you know...

**Ron Evans:** I did tell you to do that, Johnny, so I take full responsibility. We'll talk about this after the conference.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yes, over scotch...

**Ron Evans:** I'll meet you outside the bar...

**Break**: \[00:34:15.04\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, the question we asked our gophers... And again, this is for double points. "I couldn't code without..." what? What couldn't they code without? Cameron, to get control of the board, you just have to get one right. "I couldn't code without..."

**Cameron Balahan:** I guess I'll go with Stack Overflow, but... Yeah, Stack Overflow.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, I couldn't code without Stack Overflow. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] No. Okay, Johnny, for control of the board you just need to get one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** An editor/IDE? Or Emacs. That's a lifestyle on its own. I'm just saying, one of these things.

**Ron Evans:** That means Emacs. He was answering Emacs. If it doesn't say Emacs, then it's a lose.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Johnny Boursiquot says Emacs. Gophers say? \[win alert\] And again, control of the board. So Travis, what have you got to say about this? I couldn't code without... What?

**Travis Cline:** I feel like I already spent my ChatGPT card... I'm gonna go with a computer.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. I mean, what do you think of these people, that they're going to answer -- Travis says a computer. Gophers say? \[win alert\]

**Travis Cline:** Yay, first place!

**Mat Ryer:** Ron, I guarantee you can code without a computer.

**Ron Evans:** Only sometimes, Mat. Only sometimes.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay, Paula, what do we think? I couldn't code without...

**Paula Babbicola:** Documentation?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I couldn't code without documentation. That's a lovely answer. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] Nope. "I don't read the docs. Thanks."

**Paula Babbicola:** Wow...!

**Ron Evans:** Who here has actually used documentation while coding? Don't answer that.

**Paula Babbicola:** Go has such beautiful docs.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a shame. It's a shame. But anyway, you lose a life, but don't worry. Johnny, you've got two more lives. What couldn't you code without?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** A search engine.

**Mat Ryer:** A search engine. That's quite a good answer. Which one? What's your favorite?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I decline to answer that question.

**Mat Ryer:** Hm. That's weird. Okay, a search engine. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] No, I'm afraid not. Travis, one life left. You don't want to give the board away, so...

**Travis Cline:** I'm gonna risk keeping it on brand, in a way, and say Copilot.

**Mat Ryer:** Copilot. Okay. You said Copilot. Gophers say? \[fail alert\] No, they didn't. And this now means that Team Zero has a chance to steal the board.

**Ron Evans:** We can confer now, right?

**Mat Ryer:** You can confer, yeah. Please do.

**Ron Evans:** Alright, what do you guys think? Should we go with electricity? \[laughter\] Or maybe the internet. I don't know, what do you think? Cameron?

**Cameron Balahan:** The internet sounds good. Music could be another option.

**Ron Evans:** Oh, I like music, and I probably couldn't code without it, but I just don't know about these humans. What do you think?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Someone literally says "Coffee makes me a great developer." Maybe I'd say coffee.

**Ron Evans:** Alright, so what do we think? What are we gonna go with? How do you feel about the internet?

**Chioma Onyekpere:** We could go with that.

**Ron Evans:** Alright. We're gonna go with internet.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. You say internet. Gophers say... \[fail alert\] No, I'm afraid not, and that means that team one takes all those points.

**Ron Evans:** Can we see the other answers?

**Mat Ryer:** We will see the answers, yes. So at number one there we had a computer. 12 people said that. Vim, Emacs, etc. was said by 10 people. In place number three we have body parts. Six people said that.

**Paula Babbicola:** Their own body parts...?

**Mat Ryer:** It doesn't specify.

**Ron Evans:** What kind of development do they do?

**Mat Ryer:** Not clear. Not clear.

**Chioma Onyekpere:** Was there like a drop-down? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's it. And then the final answer was - you'll be kicking yourselves... Silence, music, or focus. We would have accepted any of those, which would have scored you five points.

**Ron Evans:** \[unintelligible 00:38:13.20\]

**Mat Ryer:** Some other interesting answers here... Someone said "I couldn't code without having learned BASIC on a ZX Spectrum." That's a nice answer. I also had that computer. Someone also said "I couldn't code without my cat. Apparently, at least, she's certain of that." That's nice. Quite good for passwords, though, cats.

**Ron Evans:** Natural debuggers.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Plus, they're fuzzing... Just cat humor. It's fine. Don't worry. And someone also said "I couldn't code without saying we follow all Agile principles, when in fact it's 70% Waterfall."

So let's have a look at the final scores. Team zero, you've fought valiantly. You've got 94 points, which is more than most people in the here, because they weren't playing. Well done. But to be honest, you couldn't fit this team one score into an eight-bit int... They scored 299. \[applause\]

Just for the record, Johnny is high fiving people right now. Okay, unfortunately, that's all the time we've had today. Thank you so much, everyone that took part by answering questions and being here. Thank you to our panelists. We'll see you next time, on Go Time.
