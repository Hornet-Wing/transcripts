**Mat Ryer:** Hello and welcome to Go Time, the final episode. I'm Mat Ryer, and for the last time, please welcome my co-hosts. Johnny Boursiquot is here, Kris Brandow, Ian Lopshire is here, Angelica Hill, and from Changelog, Jerod Santo. Hello, everybody.

**Jerod Santo:** Hello.

**Kris Brandow:** Hello.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Hello.

**Kris Brandow:** Hi.

**Mat Ryer:** Hello! How's it going? How are you doing, Johnny?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** How do you think it's going? How do you think it's going? \[laughter\] It's great. It's great, Mat. It's great.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, this is great. This is like a -- oh, I love this. This is like a bar. It's like we've met up at a bar, isn't it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah. Drinks in hand... Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Me too, but I am five hours ahead. Well, look, can we just reflect on what an amazing journey we've all been on here? It's kind of amazing to see and think about. Like, we've met up weekly, live, talked about computers... This back catalogue will remain available for everybody. And Jerod, is it three hundred and forty episodes then?

**Jerod Santo:** That's correct. This is episode three hundred and forty. Which is not an insignificant number, I don't think.

**Mat Ryer:** No. It's two weeks of continuous content.

**Jerod Santo:** That makes it sound kind of insignificant, actually... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** If we just went 24 hours a day, nonstop, listening to -- yeah, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Which I highly recommend.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Well, no, but if something happens and you've got two weeks left, and you think "What can I do?", just get into Go Time.

**Jerod Santo:** That's one of the things you could do. You could do the entire Go Time.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, binge the lot.

**Ian Lopshire:** Yeah, the meteor is coming. You've gotta binge it before it's over.

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, if you have done that and you've reached this point - you know, best of luck to you. Best of luck. And remembering back as well, Brian, Erik, Carlisia, the original hosts of Go Time. 79 episodes they did. And there was some great ones... Their version of Go Time was very personal, wasn't it? So it was about personalities, meeting people, digging into their lives... And I remember hearing and meeting a lot of people that way.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, theirs was really cool. I feel like the unfortunate thing was having three people on a show is -- especially three busy people who all have jobs, is that we couldn't keep it going regularly. And so we had to stop, put it on hiatus, and come up with a better plan. And that better plan has helped sustain it for the next - how many years? That was 2019, so six years almost... Which was to get more people to hang out. And if you get six, seven, eight regular co-hosts, you can scratch together two or three every week. And that proved to be a winning formula, and that's why y'all are here, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** Six years is a real long time for a podcast.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, six years. That's just the reboot.

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** What do you think, Angelica?

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, I joined late to the party. I learned what Go was, and then six months later I was like "Yeah, I'll be on Go Time..."

**Mat Ryer:** It's phenomenal.

**Angelica Hill:** I have been able to see kind of the growth a little bit, from like 2020 onwards... Because although we've had like a lovely band of co-hosts, I think it has evolved, even in the last few years, in terms of the kind of content we do. We started leaning into like series... I think we as hosts got more into a groove, and like what kind of episodes we like doing... We've got an amazing array of different guests... So although I didn't have the pleasure of listening to the older episodes when they came out, I have gone back since and listened to them, and they're brilliant... But I kind of like that Go Time throughout its life has gone through different phases of kind of tones, hosts, focuses, formats... I think it's what has enabled us to remain so relevant and interesting for so long. And I think that is honestly a big part of why having so many different hosts I think has been great, as we all bring our own little flavors, our little styles, what we like to think about. I think it's been brilliant. But obviously, I'm biased, because we're all sitting here now because we all think it's brilliant and great...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:08:31.11\] So maybe a little context for our listeners, if you're just getting caught up and you're like "What the -- what?! This is the last episode of Go Time?" Yes, it is. You are now caught up. This will be the finale of Go Time. 340 episodes. And this is not a cancellation or a failure of Go Time. Go Time has been very strong, I think, ever since we put it on reboot, and we've been putting out episodes pretty much every week for a long time, and we have a lot of listeners, a lot of loyal listeners, a lot of friends that we've made along the way, and a lot of people who are undoubtedly not happy about Go Time going away, because it's something that they love... And myself, and Adam, my partner in crime at Changelog, are well aware of that. I'm a podcast junkie. I've had my favorite show disappear. I know what that feels like. But this is not just a Go Time thing, this is actually a Changelog-wide decision that we made, to refocus on the main thing, which is the Changelog podcast. And we're actually stopping production of not just Go Time, but JS Party, and Ship It, and Practical AI... Everything that's not the Changelog. And the reasons for that - they are varied. But in brief, we've built out this portfolio of shows to a point where we're putting out seven episodes every single week. And we did that, to the best of our ability, for years now. And I think we did an alright job, but we got to the point where we couldn't really do anything else, because we had seven episodes to put out every single week... And the fact is that Adam and I want to spend time doing other things, experimenting, exploring... I want to write more code than I currently was writing... And so this was a decision that he and I made in order to help that become a reality.

So unfortunately, Go Time, along with our other pods, which we love, which is why we haven't done this - we finally did it - is going to be retired because of that. However, it's not all bad news, y'all, because the Go Time crew are not retiring from podcasting. Of course, Mat, Johnny, Angelica, Ian, Kris and Natalie are all welcome on Changelog & Friends. Mat might even be on the very first Changelog & Friends episode of the new year. And there's a brand new Go podcast in the works called Fallthrough, which I hear gophers love fallthroughs in their code... And so we're here to talk about that as well. But that's just a little bit of the why, and the context around what's happening. Mat, back to you.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, thank you very much, Jerod. I really appreciate that. I think it's worth saying, Go Time wouldn't exist without Changelog, and Go Time has been a big part of the Go community, and helping shape that community. I think we were able to put voices out that you wouldn't perhaps otherwise hear from sometimes... We got loads of technical content together... There's some really actionable knowledge episodes... This is a big resource, and it's still relevant, thanks to Go's backward compatibility promise. There's a lot of the content. And a lot of it also isn't specifically about language syntax, which may change over time. It's all still relevant. So it's like this big corpus now of knowledge that we've put together.

So I'm very grateful to you and everyone on the team, and all the co-hosts. The whole podcast, I think, was just something to be really proud of. So I'm very grateful for it, I'm really pleased it happened. And yeah, it's a bit sad that it's coming to an end, but it makes sense. And I'm excited to see what's next.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[00:12:06.15\] Yeah. Hear, hear. For me personally, GoTime was definitely a way for me to dive deeper into the world of Go. It gave me an opportunity to share my passion for the language, for the community, and it was always amazing whenever I'd go to a Go conference, and people would come up and say "Hey, you're Johnny from Go Time, right?" I'm like "Yeah..." Or somebody would hear my voice... They would be having a conversation somewhere, they'd hear my voice, they'd turn around and be like "I know that voice. Where do I know your voice from?" I'm like "Do you happen to listen to a podcast on Go?" "Yeah, that's you!" It would be amazing to get those sort of interesting situations, where people would put a face and a name and everything else, and to kind of see the impact. You don't think about it. We get on these podcasts and do these recordings every week... And oftentimes we do them and we enjoy each other's company while we record, but we don't often think about sort of the downward impact of the people who then download it, and then listen to it... We don't think of how far that sort of reaches, that domino effect. And sort of seeing that and hearing about the impact of the show over the years... It's been an incredible journey, an amazing journey. And I personally thank the Changelog team for reaching out to me all those years ago and saying "Hey, we're putting together this podcast. Here's a capacity in which you can contribute."

And yeah, it's been one of those great things that I'm very proud of to have been able to be a part of. I'm definitely going to miss it... But everything comes to an end. So perhaps this particular door closes, but other things will open up. We already know that Fallthrough is spinning out of that; that's going to be fun and interesting, I'm sure, and new things are going to emerge out of that. So this ending, so to speak, is not happening on a sad note; I'm definitely happy about that. This is not because this show and others in the Changelog catalog were failures. I think Changelog has done such an amazing job of creating these communities around these shows, and by proxy, just furthering those communities and helping them sort of grow. So definitely lots of gratitude there to the Changelog. And Jerod, he was doing that production work even before he brought on Jason to help with that... Week after week, scheduling, and all the things that have happen behind the scenes, that people have no idea about. All that work, and all that labor... And I definitely think you and the rest of the Changelog team do deserve a bit of a break, and to try and find time to sort of explore and see what's next and what's new. But yeah, overall, I'm quite happy with what we accomplished together, for sure.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's lovely, Johnny. I wasn't being sarcastic.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, I was about to say, almost as nice as your sweater, Mat.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, ignore, Mat. Go ahead, Ian. Ignore Mat. That's what we all do. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** No, because I realized it sounded sarcastic when it came out. But I didn't mean it to be.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat just cannot not sound sarcastic. It's a double negative.

**Mat Ryer:** I was going to say though, you're right, Johnny - yeah, we're ending on nice terms, and I think that is important. It's not because of a fight like we're at a conference, Johnny, and then we're playing around and you went too far, and then you've got me in a headlock for ages, and wouldn't let go.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Right, right.

**Mat Ryer:** Something like that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, that would be awkward.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that would be awkward.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That never happened. Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** That did not happen. No. That's what I'm saying.

**Jerod Santo:** Let Ian talk. Let Ian talk.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I want to hear from Ian.

**Ian Lopshire:** No, I was just kind of piggybacking off something Johnny said... I remember early in my career finding Go Time back when Brian, Erik and Carlisia were still hosting it, and learning about GopherCon, and making it to GopherCon, and meeting them... Yeah, so without Changelog and Go Time, I'm not sure I would be sitting here today. It matters.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I can echo that. Genuinely, I don't think you can really measure the impact it's had on your career, genuinely. I know for a fact it's impactful. I mean, I get it, too. I got recognized in an airport once in San Francisco, just because of my voice... It's a bit creepy.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I was going to say. It's weird, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but still... Nice. They were Go programmers, so... You've got to have a certain level of intelligence.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:16:16.14\] Well, you also get to go out there at the GopherCon stage, and sing unpopular opinions with the crowd, didn't you? I mean, that had to be a moment for you, Mat...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. That's true. The live shows.

**Jerod Santo:** Tell us that.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, those live shows... We do the Gophers Say, and we have a lot of fun messing around... They're very fun to do.

They're like a complete little subcategory of their own. I realized we did six of those; six of those episodes. Yeah, so this is the live, the game show thing where we usually get some of the speakers up from the conference, and then we play a game. The atmosphere in the room is a lot better than we were ever able to capture on audio, which is a shame... And I think we did crack it in the end, but -- I think we know how to do it now, but... So maybe we keep doing that.

**Jerod Santo:** For the next one. We know how to do it for the next one.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. They can still happen at the conferences.

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:16:58.07\] out of retirement for that.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that'd be fun.

**Jerod Santo:** I love those. Those are really funny. A little bit of the behind the scenes of that... So this is mostly happening at GopherCon Europe, where Mat and Natalie oftentimes are on stage. Sometimes it's just Mat, but... I'm literally here, halfway around the world, in Nebraska, running the Gophers Say game board, with multiple inputs to Mat. I have a cell phone call in his ear, I'm giving him like information, and then we also have the sound coming out of the soundboard, traveling around the world and then playing live there... There was one time where it was like -- it played twice, and we just couldn't do anything about it... So it was like double inside in the auditorium.

But the shining moment for me was the time where Mat got the entire crowd - and to our listener, maybe you were there for that one. I wasn't. I was here in Omaha, hearing them sing Unpopular Opinions together in unison. It was like a chorus.

It was amazing. And unfortunately, we couldn't capture the audio that did it any justice to play it on the episode that ensued... But man, that had to be just such a fun moment. This silly little jingle that Mat wrote on a whim for Unpopular Opinions becoming such a staple was just a really cool thing, that you can't really plan that kind of stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, those moments are so fun. And it's fun for me hosting those game shows, because I feel like a proper TV person at that point. Because I've got literally like -- Jerod's in my ear, and he can hear me through the other stuff. Honestly, it's the coolest I've ever felt, basically.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] It's probably the coolest you've ever been, actually.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it probably is. Looking back, I think it probably is. One time I screwed up some paper and kicked it, and it hit a wall, and rolled along a shelf, and then went in the bin. And that's a high contender.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's the second coolest.

**Mat Ryer:** Maybe. \[laughter\] So it's so fun. Yeah. Well, I love that. I love that we got to kind of -- and sometimes we were silly. We did get to be silly on Go Time. And I heard -- people told me that that did put them at ease a lot sometimes as well, and made it easier for them to relax, and then kind of chat. So I like that about it. Obviously, I like being silly. But I also like that we have other hosts with different flavors as well, so that you get this nice variety in style, too.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I taste like chocolate.

**Mat Ryer:** I bet you do. I bet you do, Johnny. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And Johnny, one of the things that I remember from you - one of your most impactful moments was when you taught me how to eat Cheetos while you're coding... Right? Was that you?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah. With chopsticks.

**Jerod Santo:** With chopsticks, exactly. That's the kind of stuff you can only learn on Go Time.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You can't put greasy fingers on your keyboards, bro. C'mon.

**Jerod Santo:** I know. I didn't realize that.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. The only issue was this came moments after Johnny chastised somebody for using chopsticks to eat salad. Johnny's like "What are you talking about? That's mad!" And then reached over and got a Cheeto, a big Cheeto with chopsticks.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah. It's a double standard. Yes.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, he just admits it. When someone can just admit it as a double standard, where do you go from there? They win, don't they?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah. You just accept it. Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay... Cool.

**Break**: \[00:20:09.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we've been talking about our unpopular opinions category, but we haven't heard much from our unpopular opinion maestro... That's Kris, the king of unpop, with the longest of rants, and the most extemporaneous thoughts shared. Kris, say some words.

**Kris Brandow:** I love my rants. My rants are fun.

**Ian Lopshire:** Yeah, if you go listen to that two weeks, one fifth of it will be Kris's rants.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true.

**Kris Brandow:** Probably... \[laughs\] Yeah, I don't know, I'm sad that Go Time is ending. I'm glad that it's ending on such a good note, such a high note. I feel like we've done some really incredible stuff over the past few years... But I'm excited for Fallthrough. I'm excited for the spinoff. I'm excited to see what we can do with it, and the way that we can kind of carry the spirit of Go Time forward into that show. And I can carry my long rants and monologues, and unpopular opinions. Both those things. They've got to say; we can't get rid of them.

So yeah, I'm excited that we're not just like ending, and saying bye, and leaving. I'm excited that we're moving on and doing something else, so there'll still be something for the community.

**Jerod Santo:** That certainly has made it an easier pill for us to swallow. Obviously, we love all of our creations here at Changelog, and we didn't want to have to retire anything. But it's so much easier to know that Fallthrough.fm - oh, go like and subscribe, of course - is going to be a thing. JS Party has a spinoff, Ship It has a spinoff etc. It's just like, if you like these shows, the spirit of the shows will live on, because the people that were on the shows want to continue podcasting. And so that makes me happy. And I think it obviously has been a lot easier to all the people who've heard about Go Time being finalized, is to say "You know what - it's over, but it's not really over. There's other things that are happening." And so they're like "Oh, okay. I can put up with that." So I'm excited about that, too, Kris.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. And I think Fallthrough is a great name. Where did the name come from?

**Kris Brandow:** So... Interestingly, it was actually a name I'd come up with a conference that I wanted to start, and maybe we'll start one day... And the idea was of it is like - you know, Fallthrough, the keyword in Go, it kind of puts you in this non-normative space. A place where you usually couldn't get, given where you've been. And I was like "Oh, I really like that name for that kind of vibe."

And then when we were talking about Go Time, and spinning off, I was like "Okay, well, usually when a podcast ends, it just kind of goes away. But we don't want it to go away. We want it to do something different, something non normative", which felt like Fallthrough was like the right name for that thing. It's like "Yeah, we hit the end of what GoTime is, but we're still going to kind of keep going, with slightly different parameters, in a slightly different way." It still feels the same. At least that's the goal of it, at the end of the day.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I think they're in safe hands with a writer's mind like that at work.

**Jerod Santo:** I agree. I heard the name and I was lik "Oh--" Once he described it, I'm like "Yeah, excellent."

**Mat Ryer:** That's great. Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** So you birth a new show?

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah. We fall through to a new show. Exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Johnny, could you possibly be referencing anything?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Hey, hey, hey, hey... You know, you get out of it, you get out of it what you heard out of it. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so we're going to leave it right there. Fair enough.

**Mat Ryer:** But we should mention Natalie also couldn't be here... She did plan to be here. Unfortunately, she couldn't. I think she's busy, would you say...?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Mat Ryer:** And you can still also hang out with Natalie if you head over to GopherCon EU. So check that out. And I usually go to those as well. And everyone should. Have you been to GopherCon EU yet?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I've been. Yeah. I was on the stage with you.

**Jerod Santo:** No, don't say it like that, Johnny. It was an open question.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You don't remember? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Johnny, it was an open question. Don't say it like "I forgot."

**Jerod Santo:** Angelica, have you been? Because you're big on GopherCon US.

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, ironically, I think it's the only Go conference I've not gone to. Not purposefully... I think it's just the way that the chips have fallen.

**Jerod Santo:** Weren't you formerly from the EU?

**Angelica Hill:** Formerly, yes.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** It sounds like an indictment. \[laughter\]

**Ian Lopshire:** I am formerly --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** What, you forgot your people? \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** I am formerly from the EU, yes.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You left and then you just turn your back?

**Jerod Santo:** That might have been more accusatory than I meant it to be, but...

**Kris Brandow:** Well, I mean, it's not like she left... It's like the UK left.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Angelica didn't go anywhere. Well, I guess she went to New York City, but...

**Angelica Hill:** No, I ironically have not been to GopherCon EU. But I hope to go at some point. Not yet, but I hope to. No, but I go to GopherCon, and all the other ones, the US-based ones. But I've heard great things...

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:28:09.02\] Yeah, they're fun.

**Angelica Hill:** They are fun. And that's the other thing, is that a lot of the people -- these lovely hosts that you don't see before you attend a lot of these conferences. So if you're missing us, you can just go to conferences, and probably one or at least two of us might be there. So there's other ways to engage if you're missing us, or if you just want to hear our voices. Not that you would, but maybe you do.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Ian, I heard you say earlier that you owe a lot of your career to Go Time. Is that true?

**Ian Lopshire:** I mean, I would say so... I mean, the Go community --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No, no, no, stop right there. I just want to -- so basically, what you're saying is you owe a portion of your earnings...

**Mat Ryer:** 20%. 20% is fine, because...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** To me. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Golang Johnny is trying to get a check here, okay? \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** Johnny is trying to steal all the credit.

**Angelica Hill:** I thought that was going to be such a beautiful moment.

**Jerod Santo:** That was going to be nice.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** And then I ruined it. \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, I think on a serious note, I do feel personally like Go Time is probably the only reason that I continue doing Go.

And also, I think it's one of the few opportunities... I mean, I joked about it at the beginning, but what other conference podcast organization would take some squirrel-looking hyperactive newbie, who literally could write a Hello World... That was it. I'm not even joking. I could write a Hello World. That was it. And Jerod was like "Hey..."

**Jerod Santo:** What are you saying? We're fools, or what?

**Angelica Hill:** No, in the best of -- well, you can judge whether it was a good or bad decision...

**Jerod Santo:** I loved it.

**Angelica Hill:** But all jokes aside -- and like would give me a chance to be on a podcast... And I actively have learned over the... It's made me a better software engineer, it's made me a better gopher... Because on most of these episodes I've had the privilege of like learning actively in that moment from these brilliant people, that otherwise I might never have been able to interact with. But being able to say "Hey, I'm a host on Go Time. I want to learn about, I want to dig into X, Y, Z topic." It has enabled me personally to interact with so many interesting, awesome people... But also given me so many other opportunities that I never would have otherwise got, by taking a chance on people. I think that's the beauty of Go Time. We bring on so many different types of people... There's not this high barrier to entry where you have to be some staff engineer, written a book... Like, we really do host episodes that are coming from all different walks of life, people, experiences... And we're able to give kind -- I can't remember who said it, but give these people... I think it might have been you, Mat... Who might otherwise have not had a forum to be able to have their voices, their opinions heard. And we go, "Yeah, sounds good. You have something interesting to say. It doesn't matter if you have one, ten, fifty, six months, one week of Go experience. If this is a topic you feel passionately about, let's get you on. Let's talk about it. Let's expose people to all the different levels and experiences."

And so personally I felt that, but also, I think that's the beauty of Go Time, and the role that I feel like and I've heard it's played in a lot of people's lives, and their Go lives, is that it's a place to feel heard, to feel listened to, to feel like you're accepted, in a way that, bluntly, I think a lot of other software engineering areas - there is a higher barrier to entry. I certainly felt this. There are spaces you go into where you just don't feel -- you feel embarrassed if you're not like a 10-year veteran of the language, and you know 17 languages.

**Jerod Santo:** Sure...

**Angelica Hill:** And it makes me really sad to think that that forum is going to go away, but then extremely hopeful, because we have Fallthrough, because we have this continuation, and because you have, you know, all of us lovely hosts who care deeply about these topics, but also care deeply about keeping that accessibility and that openness in the community, so we'll be able to push it on. But yeah, it's amazing.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:32:20.09\] Yeah. No, there's definitely something in that. I remember -- I mean, I think having different perspectives, I think that's in itself really useful, because you learn so much, and it's usually very surprising stuff. It was also nice for -- sometimes the experts didn't know the answer. And I think that was also quite nice for people to also witness. In fact, I heard people talk to me about this, that they heard -- we had somebody on that was an expert in something, and one of the questions, they were like "Oh, I have no idea. I'd have to go and dig in and find out." And they talked a bit about how they would find out. And that was actually really useful, because that's kind of the skill. It's not knowing all the things, it's really knowing how to figure out, how to find out those things.

So yeah, it felt very authentic. It wasn't any show, or trying to really be bigger than we were, or be anything that we weren't. I felt like it was very authentic, and I think that really helped also. So yeah, it was good. It was good, wasn't it?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. You learned that some of those people you think are like incredible people, are incredible people, but they're also human. Those people that you might hear of, or have heard about in the Go community, some of like the founders, for example - you get them on the podcast and you hear that funny story about what they ate for breakfast... And it humanizes them in a way that, for a lot of the listeners, because they've listened to that one episode where they saw that like Rob Pike's a human, they then might see him at a conference and be like "Oh, I remember he said that he liked ducks. Let me go up and just talk about that."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It does do that, though. It helped -- it's definitely helped my social skills. Genuinely. Because when you're hosting the podcast, you're sort of forced into a place where you have to kind of carry the show sometimes. And with some guests it's very natural and easy, and you don't notice the time flying by. Other times it's more difficult to kind of get the show to pick up... It's just kind of what happens naturally in normal kind of conversations, I think. But in Go Time, you have to sort of get through it. In real life, I'll just say "Oh, I'm sorry, my heel is hurting. I've got to go." And I'll just go.

**Jerod Santo:** Excuse me, your what?

**Mat Ryer:** My heel. \[unintelligible 00:34:27.12\] Yeah, it's always a very specific lie.

**Jerod Santo:** That's your go-to?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I'm just like "Ooh. Oh." "Are you alright?" "Yeah, but it's just my heel." "What?" "Yeah, my heel... It's just a bit-- oh, I'm just gonna..." and then I just hobble off.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** It's got to be true. That's very specific, it's got to be true.

**Mat Ryer:** Exactly. No one's going to make up that lie. Heel? Kind of \[unintelligible 00:34:46.27\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Unless they heard this show.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you're dropping gems right here, Mat. These are gems.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I don't use that now. That was 2023. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We didn't always do highly technical episodes, though. Sometimes we'd do non-technical, even to the point of more like social dynamics kind of talks. I remember we even had -- perhaps, actually, Kris, you might have led that one... We had a show on your diversity, if I remember correctly. That one was completely non-technical, and that was an interesting conversation. And we even had one or two comments come through on that episode. But yeah, I liked the fact that we didn't abide by a strict rule of "We must always be nerding out on the particulars, the esoteric, ghost stuff." We would deviate, we would step out of bounds, so to speak... And things that were relevant by some measure, or on the table. And we could feel free to go in and out, and draw outside the lines a little bit, from time to time. And I enjoyed that about the show, for sure.

**Kris Brandow:** I think that episode was actually organized by Angelica. I think you were the host of that one.

**Angelica Hill:** I know. One dream, one team. We don't need to take credit, but yes, it was.

**Mat Ryer:** No, no, credit where it's due.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:36:06.12\] Well, I heard great things for that, from people at conferences, that came up and identified as neurodiverse, and said that was just a real big surprise, to just have that subject laid out and just discussed openly. So that really did resonate. You can tell the ones that do, because you will hear back, in-person, usually. Those people remember it, and it stays with them. So that's really nice to see. And I wasn't even part of that episode, but obviously, I took credit in the moment, because... Otherwise it's really awkward. Like, I'm saying, "Oh no, you've been really nice, but I reject that. It should go towards Angelica." I'm not going to do that, am I? I'm going to say "Thank you very much."

**Jerod Santo:** Are you sure they weren't thanking you for not being on? They're like "We appreciate that one." \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** But I think that's part of what made Go Time so special, is that none of us have huge egos.

**Mat Ryer:** Well...

**Angelica Hill:** Well, actually, most of us. I see you, Mat. Most of us don't have big egos. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** She looked right at him when she said that.

**Angelica Hill:** I looked right at you. But I think it's great, because we always brainstormed together, we supported each other... I remember many an episode where there would be maybe two of us hosting, one of us couldn't make it, and then the other one stepped up... I think this was really a true collaborative, supportive environment, which - again, it all adds to the culture and the vibe and the way that you see us as hosts interact with each other. We're not just pretending to like each other. We actually do. I've got some wonderful friends out of this... And I think it really is -- like, we're all in this to create and help the community. We're not in it for ourselves. It really is like a joyous community endeavor.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, yeah. When we get together at conferences, we see each other, we hug, we hang out... It's a continuation. We just pick up right where we left off, that kind of thing. And that definitely helps when you're kind of running a show day in and day out. When you see each other as "Hey, these people are literally my friends. When I see them, I'm happy to see them." That definitely helps with doing this.

**Jerod Santo:** You guys are really setting up this Go Time reunion panel that you're going to do five years from now. "Where are they now?", you know? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** This reminds me, Johnny, when we were in Berlin... Because we did exactly that. I was so excited to see Johnny in Berlin. I gave him a hug. I gave him a hug, and I just thought --

**Jerod Santo:** Johnny didn't even remember it, Mat. He didn't even remember it.

**Mat Ryer:** No, he does remember. He mentioned it earlier. He thought I forgot about it.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you forgot it. That's right.

**Mat Ryer:** That's what he thought.

**Jerod Santo:** I forgot who forgot.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No, but you gave me a nice, nice long hug, and you're like "You feel great, mate." And I was like "It's a little awkward, Mat..." \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Just on the record, I'm not sure if that's... But I did hug him and think "This guy works out." You know what I mean? There is no doubt about it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You had enough time to feel around...?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, it's obvious, ain't it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, when you get a shot to hug Golang Johnny, you really take advantage of it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[laughs\] Oh, my God...

**Kris Brandow:** Golang Johnny...

**Mat Ryer:** Otherwise how's the gonna look any good...? I can just hear horns going. One of you New Yorkers, no doubt...

**Jerod Santo:** Seriously...

**Ian Lopshire:** That's my bad. \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** It's New York. There's always horns.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that's one diversity area we failed on. We got too many New Yorkers on this podcast.

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, it's the same for Fallthrough. I mean, three quarters of us on Fallthrough are in the New York City metro area, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Gotta fix that, man. You've gotta fix it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Goodness.

**Ian Lopshire:** You know any good Nebraskans that can join us?

**Jerod Santo:** I would be happy to join fall through at any moment's notice. I just won't have any good things to say.

**Mat Ryer:** I would love to, but I want to move to New York. I would move to New York too, though. I'd love to live in New York for a bit. I might do it.

**Angelica Hill:** You should. What's stopping you?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That sweater.

**Mat Ryer:** They don't check this. They don't check your luggage for that, do they? Is that what they're putting you through the machines for? They're like "No, that's that's going to look terrible in Central Park."

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Stop you at customs. "Sir, you can't bring that. You can't bring that in here."

**Mat Ryer:** This would kill in Central Park. Kris, back me up.

**Kris Brandow:** \[00:40:11.02\] I mean, I don't think we should be talking about killing near Central Park right now, but...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, too soon...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, dang... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, man.

**Mat Ryer:** That was another thing we always would do, is put our foot in it sometimes, which is quite fun. Yeah. We got away with it, though, I think...

**Ian Lopshire:** I did have my microphone backwards for an episode, and Kris never let me live that down. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Did everything you say come up in reverse? Like \[unintelligible 00:40:41.08\]

**Kris Brandow:** It's just, when Ian has audio issues, I'm like "Oh, is your microphone backwards?"

**Jerod Santo:** So how'd you finally figure it out, Ian?

**Ian Lopshire:** It wasn't a whole episode. It was just like the warm-up time.

**Mat Ryer:** Ian, were speaking into the cable bit that plugs into the computer? What do you mean the wrong way around? \[laughter\]

**Ian Lopshire:** It was just sitting backwards. The cardioid was pointing at my monitor.

**Mat Ryer:** They didn't make them obvious enough for that to be embarrassing, I don't think.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Is that a horn?

**Jerod Santo:** Somebody's seriously mad.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, that's New York for you.

**Ian Lopshire:** Oh, there's a school bus outside.

**Jerod Santo:** That is a sustained honk.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, yeah, no.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel like this is a good question - Jerod, did we ever have any sections of episodes that had to be like completely cut, because they were just like not suitable for air? I feel like we fluffed up and did a few things that were a little bit dodgy, but none that felt to me at least full-blown like "Why did we say that? That needs to be cut."

**Jerod Santo:** Not that I can think of. I know sometimes we would take longer conversations and maybe put them in the Changelog++ bonus, because it's just like, this went on for way too long... And so nobody --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Kris... \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** Heey...! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Every time Kris goes, "And another thing..." you're like "Oh, here we go... He's got another point."

**Kris Brandow:** Listen, I've had many people come up to me and compliment me on my monologues. Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** I enjoy your monologues... After we edit them. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** "This is part six of Kris's monologue."

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. The longest unpop ever.

**Mat Ryer:** I got some jokes -- I did get some jokes cut.

**Angelica Hill:** Did you?

**Mat Ryer:** I think so. Yeah. I think it was fair enough, you know...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No, you'd be like "Oh, we should take that out in post", and then Jerod would leave it in.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. That was one of our moves. So one of my favorite shticks that Mat ever did was the New Year's episode a couple of years ago, where he acted like you guys were having a fireside chat... Do you guys remember this?

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** I know Ian and Kris were there. Was Johnny there? I think Johnny was there. I think it was you four. And it was like the first episode of the new year, and you were like talking about how great our productions are... And then you started describing things that you heard.

*"And I want to do a special tribute to the editors and the sound technicians. They go above and beyond, I think, every year, and deserve a bit of recognition. Just listen to this fire crackle, at this fireside event. It’s just – you can hear it. It’s in HD. It’s amazing.*

*And listen in the distance, birdsong. They’re fading as the winter sun sets across the snowy rooftops. You can almost hear water trickling underneath the frozen surface of a stream. So not just water… It’s underneath kind of a layer of ice, so it’s muffled in some way. Isn’t that beautiful? An articulated lorry careens around an icy corner."*

**Jerod Santo:** You had each person say something they heard going on, like "Someone screams out for help" and we had to go back in post-production and find all those sound effects, and put them in. Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense. And we thought about just leaving them all out and making it look so stupid, but... We played along. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's funny.

**Mat Ryer:** That was great. There was a bit of meta trolling, which I always think is good. Yeah, I think it's healthy, isn't it?

**Angelica Hill:** I think there was a number of times where you had to like sandwich in positives after something like a little bit dodgy happened... I think that happened a lot, where individuals would say something about certain individuals in the community, and then you'd have to be like "Yeah, but they also are great at this. And I think that they're actually wonderful... And shout-out, actually, to them."

**Kris Brandow:** \[00:44:26.10\] That feels targeted, Angelica.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I think it might be going in a specific direction... Most of us are nice.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, I just think some of us who like to talk, and have a lot of really strong opinions, sometimes say opinions that I just want to make sure we pad a little bit, with sandwiches of positivity.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Balanced.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** I do find myself taking the like opposite opinion in a lot of episodes purposefully, so that it doesn't feel too in like one area... Which I think has got me in trouble a number of times, because I started down a route or an argument that I actually don't think is true, and then someone's asked me a question about it, and I've been like "It's a great question. I would be intrigued to hear YOUR answer actually, to that great question..."

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Like spin it right back at him.

**Angelica Hill:** The amount of times that I've done that... Like "Great question."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, before you know it, you're a flat-earther, denying the existence of Australians.

**Angelica Hill:** I don't go that far...

**Ian Lopshire:** I do remember arguing with Kris and being -- by the time I got done arguing, being like "Actually, I'm wrong." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Talk about humility... Hey, that's a good thing right there.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** He argued you into submission.

**Jerod Santo:** Because you were actually wrong, or you just wanting Kris to stop? \[laughter\]

**Ian Lopshire:** Can it be both?

**Jerod Santo:** "Okay, you win, you win..."

**Johnny Boursiquot:** "Fine, fine, fine..."

**Jerod Santo:** "Let's end the show..."

**Kris Brandow:** I'll have you know, one of my new co-hosts loves my rants, and is excited to talk with me about that, so...

**Angelica Hill:** I think they're great.

**Ian Lopshire:** We all love your rants, Kris.

**Jerod Santo:** We all love your rants, Kris.

**Angelica Hill:** We rip into you as a form of endearment and love.

**Kris Brandow:** I know...

**Angelica Hill:** We wouldn't tease you if we didn't like you. We'd just be really nice.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We'd also tease you if we didn't like you.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** But not in front of your face.

**Kris Brandow:** Ah, okay. Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Not to your face.

**Angelica Hill:** If we tease you to your face, we like you. It's when you don't hear anything negative that you should be worried.

**Mat Ryer:** Now that you mention it, Angelica, I don't ever hear anything negative about me, from you...

**Angelica Hill:** I need to shout louder...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You've tuned her out.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You'll get a voice memo next time.

**Kris Brandow:** There've just been many Roast-a-Mat episodes, and I feel like they start with Angelica saying something. I feel like it's that Brit to Brit energy...

**Angelica Hill:** I think that's true... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, there was the one -- the reunion episode, where we brought back Brian, Carlisia and Eric...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And it turned into a Mat roast-a-thon. Like, everybody was coming after Mat. I feel like you were hosting -- it might've even been a Gophers Say, or it was a game show that we were playing with them. It was like episode 200, or 300, or one of these anniversary episodes...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And Carlisia just let you have it, I remember. And I was in the background just laughing, because you were -- it was almost like the Brady Bunch, where the maid is in the middle, and the whole Brady Bunch surrounds her, and she's like looking around at everybody... That was you, only they were just like belting you with insults the entire episode.

**Mat Ryer:** Kris, if you had to pick one, what would you say is your favorite GUID?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Favorite what?!

**Mat Ryer:** GUID. Globally Unique Identifier. Microsoft loves GUIDs. Do you have a favorite, Kris? Any have caught your eye?

**Kris Brandow:** No, so I'll just answer Erik's question instead, because I like that one... So I prefer Dark Mode for my editor, and Light Mode for everything else.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, cool. Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** I wanna strike that balance.

**Mat Ryer:** Cool. Okay. I'm really not getting the respect I'd hoped for on this, with people just choosing their own questions... But let's press on. We'll press on.

**Erik St. Martin:** That's the problem with having a show full of hosts.

**Mat Ryer:** That's true.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I'm sorry, have we met? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:48:03.07\] Yeah, absolutely. And honestly --

**Jerod Santo:** It was awesome.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, was it? That does happen, though...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[laughs\] On the regular...

**Mat Ryer:** ...well, it happens because --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's just a thing that happens.

**Mat Ryer:** I think if you listen to Go Time, you feel like you really get to know each other. So people feel like they really know us, like we're their friends. So that shortcuts a lot of social usual etiquette. And what happens is they leap straight into --

**Jerod Santo:** People just make fun of you in real life, too?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, they're just immediately like "You've got a really high hairline." They'll just say that. \[laughter\] And it's a joke...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** This is the opener.

**Jerod Santo:** It's just rude.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a callback to something I've said.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like, "Excuse me, who are you?"

**Mat Ryer:** They'll sometimes make jokes at me, which are callbacks to things which I've said on the podcast, which I've forgotten. So again, they're just raw insults, in the moment...

**Jerod Santo:** Just opening wounds...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** And you're like "Why is this person insulting me?" \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I learned eventually... "Yeah. Oh, I see. It's like, we're being friends." But it's funny.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, man...

**Mat Ryer:** Someone said "Is that a wig?"

**Angelica Hill:** Really?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. "Is that a wig?" Why would I choose this? \[laughter\] You know what I mean? Imagine going -- have you gone into a wig shop on a budget?

**Ian Lopshire:** They're saying you're bald and have bad taste.

**Mat Ryer:** Right. Yeah. I'd rather just leave it as it is.

**Jerod Santo:** Mat, how about that episode that we did, that was just you traveling to GopherCon?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** And that old lady called you a wanker at the end... \[laughter\] Remember that?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** And you said "Thank you..." because you had figured out that that was their way of --

**Angelica Hill:** Did you keep that in?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, we had to. It's not a cuss word over here in the States. We don't know what it means.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it got through the filters. It's in the episode \[unintelligible 00:49:46.10\]

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, so if I swear, just not in anything American...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you can use -- bollocks, is that a swear?

**Mat Ryer:** You can say bollocks. Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** We don't know. We don't know. It just sounds cool.

**Mat Ryer:** Bollocks doesn't sound cool, does it?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] We don't know what it means. It's like "Whatever..."

**Kris Brandow:** This podcast is in American English.

**Mat Ryer:** No, but that's true. Well, that was me -- I went to GopherCon EU, I was hosting it, so I had to get the flight, and everything... And I just thought it'd be funny to just record --

**Jerod Santo:** You were just using your iPhone, weren't you?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, exactly. Just the voice memos. So I just recorded bits. And then when something funny happened, I would just record a little bit about it. And it's one of the -- yeah, it's one of the episodes. It's nice, because --

**Jerod Santo:** And then you got back and you just sent it all to me, and you're like "Can you do something with this?"

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And I'm like "Oh, great..."

**Mat Ryer:** I tried to send it in the right order. That was important. Yeah. But otherwise --

**Jerod Santo:** It turned out pretty nice, actually. It's kind of a funny, shorter episode...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it was fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Mat's GopherCon EU Diary, episode 250.

**Mat Ryer:** Everyone was saying "Danke", because I was in Germany. So they were saying "Danke!" And I thought they were saying the other thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Wanker...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Bleep that one.

**Mat Ryer:** Bleep it in the UK.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** I do appreciate how much work that you, Jerod, and the rest of the Changelog post-production team put into making us sound good... So I know there's some episodes where we were just saying stuff, and I was like "I don't know how they're going to fix this..." And then you listen to it and it's like "Nah, this sounds great." So...

**Ian Lopshire:** Taking out my 45-second pause before I answer a question...

**Jerod Santo:** That does help, doesn't it?

**Kris Brandow:** And now that I have to do that on the other side, I'm like "Oh, right, this is a lot of work..."

**Jerod Santo:** It is a lot of work.

**Kris Brandow:** Especially is we're gonna do video, too...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, shout-out to our editor, Jason, who did the content edits for Go Time, and the mastering for Go Time for the last couple of years. Without him, it was even harder...

**Mat Ryer:** Thanks, Jason...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Jason's awesome.

**Mat Ryer:** Thanks, Jason. Yeah, it's true. And guests would also say that. They'd say -- one time someone asked me where the script was.

**Jerod Santo:** Wow.

**Mat Ryer:** And I said "No, no, there's no script." And they're like "What? This just happens?" So that was a big compliment. Quite a surprise as well. But yeah. So they were surprised by -- it feels very natural when you're actually... It's just like a Zoom call. You sat, chatting about something.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:52:09.22\] Exactly.

**Mat Ryer:** And you quickly forget about the mics. You quickly forget you're on a podcast, don't you? So you end up just talking in a little group, basically. So that's the experience. And then when it comes out, people were very shocked by exactly that. The production value, just how good it sounds when it's in that context, how legit it sounds next to other podcasts... Yeah, people are very complimentary.

And I'm thrilled to be on it. I think, like you said, we had so many guests, we had so many different people speaking, talking about all sorts of stuff... We had more speakers than a Bang & Olufsen restaurant.

**Jerod Santo:** That one was scripted...

**Mat Ryer:** No, but would that be loud, or just a high-quality audio restaurant...? But yeah, lots of people had a great time also doing their episodes, and I think that's quite nice, too. They've got their own little bits they can point to.

**Jerod Santo:** And do we have any highlights from the panel, in terms of an episode that you love, or something you may go back to and listen to, even once Go Time is dead and gone?

**Kris Brandow:** I still love that maintenance miniseries that I did... I just really love those episodes. I don't know what it is about those episodes, but I go back and listen to them, and I'm like "There's a lot of interesting stuff in there." It's good stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** It's actionable stuff, I think. That's what I like. I like those episodes where you can listen to it and then you know -- you're changed at the end of it, because now you think in a slightly different way about some problem.

**Jerod Santo:** Like how to eat Cheetos while you're coding.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, exactly. With chopsticks, of course.

**Jerod Santo:** It changed my life. I haven't tried it yet, but mentally I'm different.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. He types with Twizzlers as well. I don't know \[unintelligible 00:53:40.04\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** I --

**Mat Ryer:** I loved the defer one.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Sorry.

**Angelica Hill:** Go on.

**Mat Ryer:** No, go on.

**Angelica Hill:** I'll defer to you, Mat.

**Jerod Santo:** Ohh...! Now we have to leave it in.

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'll do it in a bit.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh.

**Jerod Santo:** Double defer.

**Angelica Hill:** No, you have to do it now.

**Jerod Santo:** Triple defer. Who's the most courteous? It's a courteous-off.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's a polite-off.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Mat Ryer:** I believe we have ours--

**Angelica Hill:** Okay, I liked -- Mat! So what I liked the best was... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** He's got shushed.

**Jerod Santo:** The real Angelica, please stand up... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** "Who owns our code."

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Luis Villa:** If you manufactured a car wheel, and the car wheel explodes because you used bad materials in that case, in the car wheel, then we have some well-developed laws and intuitions around "Okay, well, we sue the car wheel manufacturer." Software doesn't have any of that really yet. We've sort of operated in this rules-free zone where everybody was like "Software is so cool! I guess we'll just let it happen." And I think that age is coming to an end,

**Angelica Hill:** I love that one. I loved that, part one and two.

**Ian Lopshire:** I literally put that in the notes.

**Kris Brandow:** Yo, Angelica, how did you just steal an Ian's favorite episode?

6 Because I loved it, because I think I learned so much, and I think it was really interesting... We got a really great guest, who really knew what they were talking about, which was great. I think it was one of the episodes where I came out of it feeling both that I had learned a lot, and really enjoyed the conversation, but also that it was an episode that would be really helpful for anyone who was interested in that question... So I loved doing that one. I think that was great.

**Ian Lopshire:** Yeah. That one was approachable, yet insightful.

**Mat Ryer:** That's a nice advert.

**Jerod Santo:** That sounded like a Goodreads, didn't it?

**Mat Ryer:** It would be a nice advert if it didn't have the police sirens, the New York police sirens in the background... \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** Listen, there's a lot going on in this city.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That was like a peaceful sort of mindfulness thing, except you've got the horrific sort of sirens going off; something terrible's happened.

**Angelica Hill:** You get used to it. You kind of drown it out.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah. Breathe in... Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee!! ...breathe out. \[laughs\]

**Kris Brandow:** The sirens I don't mind. What I do mind is people honking their horn for 90 seconds at 2 AM. Those people -- when congestion pricing finally was like "Yeah, we're doing it", I'm like "Good. It should be double." Because I'm tired of these people honking their horns at night. Just keep raising it until people stop honking their horns.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:56:08.08\] It should be an SLO for how much you're allowed to spend on your horn... You can spend it all in one go, but that's it. Then you have to shut up for the rest of the week.

**Angelica Hill:** You're done.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. So more like the little paps; just like pap-pap, just to let just to let them know you're there. That's all it's for. Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Thank you, observability Mat. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Our range of products' available at Grafana Labs.

**Jerod Santo:** This sentence brought to you by...

**Mat Ryer:** Grafana Labs Incorporated.

**Jerod Santo:** You're going to steal mine. Don't steal it.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, which one is yours? Because I've got two. I'll pick the other one. See what good sport I am?

**Jerod Santo:** My favorite Go Time episode of all times was episode 235, "205**Johnny Boursiquot:** A Go Odyssey" with Ron Evans from the future. This was the best, and a complete surprise and delight to me, because I had nothing to do with it until it showed up in post-production, and I'm like "This is amazing." So much so that we even -- we've had Ron on Changelog & Friends a few times. He's a regular over there, and I had him go through the entire backstory of how that episode came together.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, great.

**Jerod Santo:** So there's a 20-minute storytelling session over there of Ron's perspective of that, but... This was just too much, Mat. This was kind of your -- not your idea, but you prompted him to have this idea, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we talked about mistakes that he saw that we're making, and he wanted to talk about them. And so the idea was he would beam in from the future...

**Ron Evans:** This is the reason why I'm making this call. I'm using all of the battery energy that I've saved for several years in order to make this transmission, to send you a warning from the future. You see, I am the last Go programmer alive in 2053.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** What? No, don't say that.

**Ron Evans:** And it's terrible. All I do is maintenance programming. I haven't added a new feature in over 20 years.

**Mat Ryer:** So he's in like a dystopian future, and he's beamed in somehow and he's interrupted the signal, and then he's telling us warnings from the future. That was the idea. And he went -- he was in a studio, he had like a set...

**Jerod Santo:** He went all out.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. He had like LED lights... It looked like he was genuinely -- like it is a podcast. It was not on video.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Although I think that is, isn't it?

**Jerod Santo:** We were doing Go Time live back then on YouTube, and so there was a live video...But yeah, for the large, large majority of the audience, they did not get to see what he looked like that day. And it was preposterous and amazing.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. And it's worth listening to, just because he's such a character. And Natalie and I were sort of just trying to tame him really on that episode.

**Jerod Santo:** You guys played along really well. It was really well done.

**Mat Ryer:** It's all we could do. All you can do with Ron is "Yes, and..." That's my advice to you if you meet him in real life. And you'll have a great time. Actually, he's a fantastic bloke as well. And he does a lot for the Go community. So again, it's nice to celebrate Ron. But yeah, that episode... And also, I loved John Gregory's talk. He did the "Seven deadly Gopher sins" around Halloween one time.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** So he translated some classical list of deadly sins into Go sins. And what a fun way to sort of look at it and go through it. And I don't think we ever got any complaints, did we, Jerod? Did we get ever any complaints for any episodes, or anything?

**Jerod Santo:** That's a lot of evers, and anys. Yes, we've gotten complaints throughout the years, but not about that particular episode, I don't think.

**Mat Ryer:** Alright.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. I mean, everybody has opinions... It's the internet, so we have opinions and complaints, but --

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. That'd be a good episode.

**Jerod Santo:** Just to read them all off?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's kind of like the mean tweets thing they do. Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Go Time, the hate. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, there's an old adage on the internet, "Don't feed the trolls." You know?

**Angelica Hill:** There are some horrendous individuals out there, so let's not do that.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, there's not... Is there? Aww...

**Angelica Hill:** We're not going to bring the mood down.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Kris Brandow:** Keep the mood up.

**Jerod Santo:** Keep the mood up.

**Angelica Hill:** \[01:00:02.26\] Keep the mood up. There's been so much positive feedback on Go Time. Let's read some of that out. Let's make a song or a rap about all the positive things said in episode... And I'm going to tap Mat, because you're great at jingles, and I also feel obligated to say something nice to you, because I've been a middle bit of a not nice person to you during this entire episode... \[laughter\] You should do the jingle, because you're so great... Also, that was an example of where I was not trying to be sarcastic. Being English makes me sound sarcastic. I think that would be very fun... And maybe we can do it for the five-year reunion. That could be fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Love it.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** Five-year reunion... That's in like 2029? I don't want to think that far ahead.

**Angelica Hill:** Time will fly when you're having fun.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** If you're having fun.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, don't have fun is the advice, isn't it? Time flies. Time is going too quick, so... Apparently though, that's because you need more diversity in your day if that's happening. So get out there, kids...

**Kris Brandow:** Yea, just look at some social media. That'll give you some diversity.

**Jerod Santo:** I love how Mat tried to turn that into a teachable moment... Ian has to pop off. Ian, anything to say before you say goodbye?

**Ian Lopshire:** Oh, I feel on the spot now.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you are, man...

**Ian Lopshire:** No, just sad to see this go, but I'm excited for Fallthrough. I hope you'll join us over there... I think you'll like it. We've got one episode in the bag, and I think you'll like it.

**Mat Ryer:** Nice.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You've gotta have some sort of a come-on. You've gotta say "Hey, come on through. Why don't you fall through?" Something. You've gotta sell it, man. You've gotta sell it.

**Jerod Santo:** Fall on through to the other side, you know? Like the old song.

**Ian Lopshire:** I'll let Kris come up with that.

**Kris Brandow:** We do have a little singer at the end of our trailer. It's a little play on words.

**Mat Ryer:** It can't be follow through. It can't be that.

**Kris Brandow:** No, no...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** There's no way around. Only through. Like workshopping, you know? \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** I'm sure we'll figure it out. We've got some big things planned, so I'm sure something will fall out of it. So...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh. You were so close there.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Fall through it?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... See? You need to get Johnny on board. He's got all the puns.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, man. I'll see you through it. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Make sure you never fall. Okay...

**Ian Lopshire:** Alright. Well, I will see you all at the reunion, five years from now...

**Jerod Santo:** Awesome. See you, Ian.

**Angelica Hill:** Well, hopefully before then... We've just been talking about how \[unintelligible 01:02:28.11\]

**Jerod Santo:** "See you in five years, suckers...!"

**Angelica Hill:** We've just been talking about how much we will like each other. "Bye! I never have to see you again..." \[laughter\]

**Ian Lopshire:** Alright... See you soon. And goodbye.

**Jerod Santo:** Much better.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Goodbye.

**Jerod Santo:** Goodbye.

**Kris Brandow:** Bye, Ian. See you on the Go Time on Fallthrough. Go Time on Fallthrough. That's what we've gotta do. Listen, there were plenty of Go Time puns, so there'll be plenty of Fallthrough puns. It'll just -- it'll come out in the wash.

**Jerod Santo:** It takes time to percolate, you know?

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, you've got to work through some of those.

**Kris Brandow:** Exactly. There's gonna be a lot of through things.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe by next fall, you'll have something.

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah. A lot of falling, a lot of throughing... \[laughter\] Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, I guess we could have all said goodbye, unless - Mat, is there more on your agenda for this? I mean, how do you end -- it's like ending the final episode of Seinfeld. I don't know. In Seinfeld they all just walked different directions, you know? Actually, that was not the finale. And in the finale of Seinfeld, they were all in jail, I think.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, were they?

**Jerod Santo:** So we can't do that.

**Mat Ryer:** No.

**Jerod Santo:** But there is the episode where they -- are you guys Seinfeld watchers? They all get off of the subway, and the episode's over, and they don't really know what to do. They're all just standing there and they all just walk different directions, and the episode ends. I thought it was kind of poetic.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's nice. Well, I suppose we will walk different directions from here... But yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** Without our signature last segment?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, could we do it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Unpops?

**Kris Brandow:** That feels wrong.

**Mat Ryer:** But think of how unpopular that would be.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That would be unpopular.

**Mat Ryer:** Exactly. Isn't that the perfect --

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, good point.

**Mat Ryer:** Isn't that the perfect way to end it?

**Kris Brandow:** \[01:04:09.03\] The final unpopular opinion...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We've get some troll on the internet saying, "Y'all just mailed it in."

**Kris Brandow:** Final unpopular opinion: unpopular opinions are not good.

**Angelica Hill:** You don't want me to randomly think of an unpopular opinion. Jerod's done it a number of times... That doesn't work.

**Break**: \[01:04:27.19\]

**Jingle:** \[01:06:50.15\]

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I do have one. Mine is that my password is too complicated now. It's slowing me down.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's your password? "It's slowing me down"?

**Mat Ryer:** That's not my password.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll be right back... I've got to go log into a few bank accounts...

**Mat Ryer:** It's longer than that. It's this really long, secure password, because it was hammered into me by security people who came on Go Time and told me "You need a nice, big, long password..." I use 1Password, or an equivalent password manager... I don't want to give too many clues away to the hackers. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Where is it that you log into this password manager?

**Mat Ryer:** So it remembers all my complicated passwords. So the real passwords are way too complicated for me. But my one for that even, and for my computers and stuff, is just too much. And I'm losing -- I think over the year it's hours here, I'm talking about.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, use a passkey. Isn't that the new hotness? A passkey.

**Mat Ryer:** How do you log into your computer with it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, I don't know.

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, that's with the biometrics. Use that fingerprint, bro.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** I've got a cool mechanical keyboard that's heavy in metal.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:08:16.00\] Well, that's what's slowing you down...

**Mat Ryer:** That is slowing me down.

**Jerod Santo:** It's heavy?

**Mat Ryer:** It's very heavy, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** And metal?

**Mat Ryer:** Made of metal. Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Well, I have an unpopular opinion. My unpopular opinion is that Mat's unpopular opinion was actually a joke hidden as an unpopular opinion, and that our listeners are actually going to love it, and so they would vote Yes. So I think it was good. My unpopular opinion is that yours was a good one.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's quite meta, isn't it? I didn't know you were allowed to turn the unpopular opinion format against each other...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** My unpopular opinion is that your unpopular opinions are not that unpopular.

**Mat Ryer:** Get him, Johnny. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Not so big now, eh, Jerod? Johnny works out. He works out!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like I just played rock and Johnny played paper right on top of it.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah. Another unpopular one I've got is AI -- we don't really need to code as much as we used to now with AI helpers. And I think everyone should embrace them, and get them to accelerate what they're doing. That's my -- and maybe that's unpopular, but...

**Kris Brandow:** It's certainly unpopular with me, but...

**Mat Ryer:** I know. And I think there's the ethical side. I think that ship has sailed. I just don't see how we put that genie back in the bottle. And therefore, let's...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Embrace it?

**Mat Ryer:** ...let's use it to our advantage.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's embrace it. Just throw ethics to the wind.

**Mat Ryer:** I was like this with the calculator though, when that came out. It was the same.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You were trying to stick to the abacus?

**Kris Brandow:** Probably spell check and grammar check, too... You were like "Oh, let's just use these tools all the time."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah...

**Angelica Hill:** Wait, how old are you, Mat?

**Kris Brandow:** Ancient... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, yeah, the calculator. No, that was out already.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you actually 70?

**Mat Ryer:** That was out for ages, even before I was born. Not born. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I mean, if your hairline is any indication, you might be up there, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Aww... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** I was this close, this close to making the same joke...

**Jerod Santo:** We almost made it off the pod without that...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** It's evergreen. It's evergreen.

**Mat Ryer:** It's certainly not... What I always say, what my mum told me, is "What I lack in hair, I more than make up for in face. So if face is your thing, I'm your man."

**Angelica Hill:** Do you want to know something?

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, please.

**Angelica Hill:** In the few interactions that we've had, Mat, I've heard you tell that joke three times.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, no...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** He forgets. He forgets. Perhaps it's a sign of age, I don't know. He forgets. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's true. So...

**Jerod Santo:** It's a go to.

**Mat Ryer:** This is not a joke.

**Angelica Hill:** I love it.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like you trigger a subroutine, you know? Mat just calls a function.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mat, he just keeps walking -- he's the one walking right into them, you know? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Mat, do you have a stock response for when someone says what Angelica just said to you?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, I just let people have their moment, really. I don't wanna --

**Jerod Santo:** What did your mum always tell you about this moment?

**Mat Ryer:** She said "If you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."

**Jerod Santo:** That one is fresh. I've never heard that one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, man...

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 01:11:24.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** Mat's sincerely regretting this unpop segment...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, yeah. So I don't know... Kris, what do you think about AI? Do you not use Cursor? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We don't have all day...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Switching up...

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, well, here's a good model to -- no.

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 01:11:41.00\] Kris, what do you think about AI? Take the stage...

**Mat Ryer:** Using it to make coding quicker...

**Kris Brandow:** \[01:11:52.22\] I mean, generative AI is -- I mean, yeah, it helps you in the short term, but I just think the long-term ramifications are pretty rough. We're currently in an industry that's in crisis because not enough people know how to build enough of the stuff... So we don't have good ways of really building solid low-level stuff that we need. And you have like three people maintaining some of the most critical infrastructure that we have. You don't want people building OpenSSL to be using AI-generated code.

Also, AI is going to be average, kind of by definition. It's taking in all the code, the good, the bad, the best, and it's spitting out the medium of it. So I guess if we want to all have a bunch of average code... But I don't know, over here in America, we like being number one. The best. And that's not going to happen if you just have a bunch of average code floating out there. You want to have the best code. And the best code requires some human element and some training. A little more than what AI can give you. But if you want to sit down and use it, I'm like "Okay, but just be prepared to fall behind and not be as good in the future."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, you definitely have to still be a part of the process. You can't just let it do it. I asked it once to retry an HTTP request if it failed, and it just put that code in line. And so I was like "No, I don't want that. I want you to create a type that can do this." So you do still need that knowledge. You can't really get away from that. And I think you also need to own the code that it generates as well, like you said. It can't just be --

**Kris Brandow:** It's like one of those -- it sounds like a good idea until you realize that you already need to have the knowledge of how to write the code well in order to use it... And then if you already have the knowledge of how to write the code well, then why do you need this thing that's writing the code for you? Why not focus on tools or language features that allow you to write that code more concisely in the first place? So it's like - yeah, sure, if you have to write a whole bunch of verbose code to implement this thing, AI might help you. But we could also be working on adding more language features or more IDE features that just allow us to write those things more concisely, or building libraries that allow us to write that more concisely... And then you're not dealing with kind of the garbage that AI tends to spit out quite often.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I think the technology that is doing what you describe is the AI. I think that is the technology that is helping us do those things better. And it's a trade-off, like you say; it's not always perfect, it's not always right. You still really do have to -- you have to kind of babysit it. It's like having a junior dev that can type really quickly. But yeah, it's like autocomplete. I mean, it is autocomplete, really, in a way...

**Kris Brandow:** It's like autocomplete that's just wrong 10 percent of the time or more.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If you keep an eye on it though, and guide it...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** But 90 percent, though... That takes you a long way. I mean, in most cases, that's good enough.

**Kris Brandow:** But I do think also -- for individual usage, I think it's good. But when you look at also how much energy and all of that it takes to train it and the impact it's having on the world, it doesn't really seem like it's worth it so that you can write your code a little bit faster. It just seems like maybe we should not be boiling the planet, so that I don't have to go learn some library or something like that, or so I can ask the computer questions that I should probably already know the answer to.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Well, unfortunately, Kris in New York deciding on moral grounds not to use AI because he doesn't want the oceans to boil is going to have zero impact on the industry's movement towards that trend.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh yeah, of course. I mean, I'm not saying like we're just going to stop AI tomorrow, but... I don't know. Someone asked my opinion, so I gave my opinion.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, no, and I think it's quite convincing. I think you might convince some people... It's just -- we did a hackathon, and I was writing React code, which I've never really written... TypeScript, React. I was dealing with that stuff, and probably prototypy quality level, if we're honest. I would want someone who really knows it to probably rewrite it, frankly, at this moment. But yeah, there's times where that autocomplete just really does accelerate it.

\[01:15:57.05\] There are other times where its suggestions lead you down the wrong path. And I have the experience enough maybe to know that, and others might not. And so I do think we have to be cautious with this. But you have to know what to press on a calculator, too.

**Kris Brandow:** If I were to have an unpopular opinion about this topic, I would say that we should stop calling it artificial intelligence, and start calling it like maybe digital intelligence, or just call it intelligence... It feels kind of derogatory to computers to call it like "artificial". Like, what's special about human intelligence that we've got to call it artificial over there? Why can't it just be regular intelligence? But then if you go look at the actual history and path of where we got to artificial --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's how it starts. We annoy them so much they just say "You know what? Let's take these humans out."

**Kris Brandow:** Well, not that much... But when you scratch that surface, you find some things that are less than pleasant... So I think that's why the artificial is there a lot of the time. But I'm in favor of, you know, just call it intelligence. Let's start defining what intelligence means, and broadening that field, and then figure out how digital computers can augment human intelligence, and make us better at what we do... Instead of just trying to recreate human intelligence. Like, something that augments us, and makes us better. It doesn't try to be us. Digital computers are not biological entities.

**Jerod Santo:** I like your last, like, 20 seconds. \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** Jerod's like "I'm just going to edit it down to that 20 seconds."

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. That might be all people hear. No... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Just be like "I'll clip it right there."

**Jerod Santo:** That was a good 20 seconds, Kris.

**Kris Brandow:** There's build-up to get to that, you know... But for an actual unpopular opinion, I'm actually happy that Go Time is ending, and that we're actually starting something new, with a different name. I think that there's a lot that I love about Go Time, but it started to feel, at least for me, a little constraining being so focused on Go, and I wanted to kind of expand out just a little bit more. And I feel like that's what we're going to do with Fallthrough. So I'm really excited for that, and I would much rather us kind of make that move now, when Go Time is still at its height, still shipping regularly, still having lots of listeners... Instead of at a point in time in the future where it just kind of fades away into nothingness. So I'm happy that it's ending, as bittersweet as that is.

**Mat Ryer:** I can't wait to see that one go out on the polls to find out if people think that's unpopular, Kris... I hope they do. Hopefully, that wins the all-time -- that just smashes it and wins the entire thing.

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, I've had some really unpopular opinions, Mat, so I don't know...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** None from Angelica...

**Angelica Hill:** No, I don't have an unpopular opinion... Because whenever I do an unpopular opinion, Jerod tells me off, because it's too random...

**Kris Brandow:** It's the last time, Angelica... Just generate one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We'll cut it out in post... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, Jerod will cut it out anyway.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Just generate one, we'll cut it out later...

**Angelica Hill:** My unpopular opinion is that people that know little to nothing about the topic at hand are much more interesting to listen to than people who think they know everything about it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Ooh... I like it.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that the Dunning-Kruger thing? Or am I just making it up because I don't know enough about it \[unintelligible 01:19:24.17\] \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** The reason I say this is because people who acknowledge that they know little to nothing about a topic I think will be more curious, will ask more interesting questions, will make things more accessible for others, and will lower the barrier to entry. So there is reasoning behind this unpopular opinion.

**Jerod Santo:** I love it, Angelica. I think you just won the podcast right there.

**Angelica Hill:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Because you're describing yourself on the show, right?

**Angelica Hill:** \[laughs\] No...?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Was that like a low-key shade a little bit?

**Jerod Santo:** No, because -- from your earlier statement about the new eyes.

**Kris Brandow:** Jerod out here dragging people...

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:20:03.22\] No, I just feel like she maybe should have let it left unsaid, I guess...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Geez...

**Jerod Santo:** She just won the show.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Jerod...! \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's the final episode. Let's get it all out. Let's get it all out on the table.

**Angelica Hill:** Tell me how you really feel, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we have to end it now, I guess...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Hey, what about my unpopular opinion? I don't matter?

**Jerod Santo:** Yours was that mine was bad.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, I guess I did get it in...

**Jerod Santo:** It was so long ago that you forgot about it.

**Kris Brandow:** Come on, Johnny... We've got to get one more Johnny unpopular opinion.

**Jerod Santo:** Go ahead, Johnny. Angelica has to bounce, but... Go ahead, Johnny.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Alright, alright, alright. And actually, this one's a serious one for me, because over the last couple of years I think I've really -- like, social media has really sort of turned me sort of off. I really don't like -- I don't find the same joy in using Twitter as I once did, or even now Blue Sky, that's like spinning up, and there's some activity, and it's a little better... But now it just feels like everything is just about attention grabbing, and just trying to spike my stress for views, and engagement farming... Like, everything just seems to be like just seeking something other than just community building. It's just hypercommercialized, and it just feels different. And honestly, I'm contemplating just getting off all these things, shutting down accounts, deleting these things. It's no longer -- I find myself sort of valuing... And I always did sort of value the face to face interactions, but the thing is, I wouldn't have met the people that I now know, all of you -- I met you online before I met you in person. I wouldn't have never come across and built these relationships without having these online communities. But man, I'm wondering what the trade-off is now, because every time I go online, I feel worse for wear. I have an experience, online, and everything else, I'm just like -- "Uhh." I don't want to be in these spaces anymore, so I'm contemplating just shutting these accounts down, just... It'll be sad, but I don't know, perhaps I'm at the point in my life where I'm like perhaps I value my mental health more than follower counts, or likes, or things like that. But I still have a presence in the community, I still like to do good things, I still like to have workshops, I still like to reach people in some way... But maybe I need to find a different way to do that, that doesn't involve being on these platforms, because they're just not good for my mental health.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that really resonates. I don't know how unpopular that will be, honestly... Yeah, I feel like that's true. There are times when it's nice, but you just can tell it's algorithms feeding you stuff. I get notifications for things which would outrage me if I read it and took it literally. So I'm getting notifications for things to outrage me now through that X app. I don't get it through the others, but... Yeah, and I know why that's happening. It's just literally to drive all that attention. But I think so.

\[01:23:08.02\] But I do feel like we need to change. We need to grow up now out of this, into something else, and I think that's what will inevitably happen. I don't know what that looks like yet, but... Yeah, I know what you mean. I think breaks, especially; take breaks from that. If you find yourself waking up and the first thing you're doing is scrolling, and just having like --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Doom scrolling...

**Mat Ryer:** ...a hundred different ideas very quickly injected into your brain immediately, that is an unusual thing to happen. And certainly, you wouldn't say it was a very natural thing in how we've lived before. So yeah, there is something about that.

I know people that -- and I do this sometimes. I don't always remember... But basically, leave your phone elsewhere, not near your bed, so that it's not the thing that it became, where it's just like an extension of yourself. It's a tool that you use sometimes. So that was quite nice, to do that a bit...

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah, I watched a YouTube video about -- I don't know if it was about attention spans; it was about like maybe attention spans and social media.

**Mat Ryer:** How long was it?

**Jerod Santo:** Did you get to the end?

**Kris Brandow:** The link in presidential debates and how they were like three hours long, and there was like a one-hour opening statement... And because people were used to reading books, they could like hold their attention for that whole hour, and hold that attention over the course of three hours. And now that we're so used to short snippets of information that we consume, we just don't have as much of the ability to do that. But one of the ways you can kind of combat that, because our brains are so plasticky, and they can kind of mold to their... They have plasticity; that's the word, not plasticky. Plasticity.

**Jerod Santo:** Cheers.

**Kris Brandow:** Cheers.

**Jerod Santo:** And thanks to you all for listening. It wouldn't be a podcast without your ears.

**Mat Ryer:** Spiritually true, definitely.
